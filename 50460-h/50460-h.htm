<hr class="d1" />

<p><span class="smcap">A distressing</span> experience in the writer’s family many
years ago brought home to his mind the danger of
premature burial, and led ultimately to the careful study
of a gruesome subject to which he has a strong natural
repugnance. His collaborator in the volume has himself
passed through a state of profound suspended animation
from drowning, having been laid out for dead&mdash;an experience
which has induced him in like manner to investigate
the various death-counterfeits. The results of the
independent inquiries carried on by both of us in various
parts of Europe and America, and by one of us during
a sojourn in India in the early part of this year, are now
laid before the reader, with such practical suggestions
as it is hoped may prepare the way for bringing about
certain needed reforms in our burial customs.</p>

<p>The danger, as I have attempted to show, is very
real&mdash;to ourselves, to those most dear to us, and to the
community in general; and it should be a subject
of very anxious concern how this danger may be
minimised or altogether prevented. The duty of
taking the most effective precautions to this end is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
one that naturally falls to the Legislature, especially
under a Government professing to regard social questions
as of paramount importance. Fortunately, this is a non-party
and a non-contentious question, it imperils no
interest, so that no formal obstruction or unnecessary
delay need be apprehended; and it should be urged
upon the Government to introduce and carry an effective
measure at the earliest opportunity, not only as a security
against the possibility of so terrible an evil, but to quiet
the widespread and not altogether unreasonable apprehension
on this subject which is now so prevalent.</p>

<p>It has been found convenient to retain throughout the
body of the work the use of the singular pronoun, but
every part of the book receives the cordial approval of
both authors, and with this explanation we accept its
responsibility jointly.</p>

<p>We have to acknowledge our great indebtedness in
preparing this volume to many previous writers, including
such as have investigated the phenomena of suspended
animation and the signs of death, and such as,
with a more practical intention, have dwelt upon the
danger of death-counterfeits being mistaken for the
absolute extinction of life, illustrating their counsels or
warnings by numerous instances. Grouping both classes
of writers together, we may mention specially the names
of Winslow and Bruhier, Hufeland, Struve, Marcus Herz
and Köppen, Kite, Curry, and Anthony Fothergill; and,
of more recent date, the names of Bouchut, Londe,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
Lénormand, and Gaubert (on mortuaries), Russell
Fletcher, Franz Hartmann, and Sir Benjamin Ward
Richardson.</p>

<p>A work to which we are particularly indebted for the
literature of the subject is that of the late Dr. Félix
Gannal, “Mort Apparente et Mort Réelle: moyens de
les distinguer.” Paris, 1890. Dr. Gannal, having qualified
in medicine and pharmacy, occupied himself with
the business of embalming, which he inherited from his
father. He employed the considerable leisure which the
practice of that art left to him in compiling the above
laborious work. He examined many books, pamphlets,
theses, and articles, from which he cited expressions of
opinion on the several points&mdash;in a lengthy form in his
original edition (1868), in a condensed form in the second
edition. His Bibliography is by far the most comprehensive
that has been hitherto compiled. Our own
Bibliography had been put together from various sources
before we made use of Dr. Gannal’s. It includes several
titles which he does not give; while, on the other
hand, it has been considerably extended beyond its
original limits by transcribing titles which we have found
nowhere but in his list. The Bibliography, it need
hardly be said, is much more extensive than our own
reading; but it seemed useful to make it as complete as
possible, whether the books had been seen by us or not,
so as to show in chronological order how much interest
had been aroused in the subject from time to time&mdash;in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
one country more than another, or in various countries
together. The titles of articles in journals, which belong
for the most part to the more recent period, have been
taken from the Index Catalogue of the Surgeon-General’s
Library, Washington, a few references being
added to articles which have otherwise come under our
notice.</p>

<h2 class="p4">INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<hr class="d1" />

<p><span class="smcap">A concurrence</span> of peculiar circumstances, beginning
in May, 1895, has directed public attention in England
to the subject of premature burial, probably to a greater
degree, so far as the author’s recollection serves, than at
any time during the past half-century. Amongst these
may be mentioned the publication of several recent
cases of premature burial in the English and American
papers; the narrow escape of a child found in Regent’s
Park, London, laid out for dead at the Marylebone
Mortuary, and afterwards restored to life; the issue
in Boston, U.S., of Dr. Franz Hartmann’s instructive
essay, entitled, “Buried Alive: an Examination into the
Occult Causes of Apparent Death, Trance, and Catalepsy”
(a considerable number of copies having been
sold in England), and the able leading articles and
correspondence on the subject in the <i>Spectator</i>, <i>Daily
Chronicle</i>, <i>Morning Post</i>, <i>Leeds Mercury</i>, <i>The Jewish
World</i>, <i>Plymouth Mercury</i>, <i>Manchester Courier</i>, <i>To-Day</i>,
and many other daily and weekly journals.</p>

<p>It is curious, that while many books and pamphlets
relating to this important subject have been issued in
France and Germany, no adequate and comprehensive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
treatise has appeared from the English press for more
than sixty years past, nor writings in any form, with
the exception of a paper by Sir Benjamin Ward
Richardson in No. 21 of the <i>Asclepiad</i>, published in
1889, on the “Absolute Signs of Death,” sundry
articles in the medical journals from time to time,
and a London edition of Dr. Hartmann’s volume in
January, 1896. The section upon “Real and Apparent
Death” in the 1868 edition of the late Professor Guy’s
<i>Forensic Medicine</i> begins with the words, “This subject
has never attracted much attention in England,
and no medical author of repute has treated it at any
length”&mdash;a remark not less true after the lapse of a
generation. The following chapters have been prepared
with the view, not so much of supplying this
omission, as of guiding the public to the dangers of our
present mode of treating the apparent dead, in the hope
that reforms and preventive measures may be instituted
without delay in order to put an end to such unnecessary
domestic tragedies.</p>

<p>In introducing the subject the author is aware that
the great majority of the medical profession in this
country are either sceptical or apathetic as to the
alleged danger of living burial. Many do not believe
in the existence of death-trance or death-counterfeits,
and the majority of those who do believe in them
declare that cases are very rare, and that if consciousness
is ever restored in the grave it can only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
last a second or two, and that those who live in fear
of such an occurrence should provide for a <i>post-mortem</i>
or for the severance of the jugular vein.
Many persons, on the other hand, after much careful
inquiry, are of opinion that cases of premature burial
are of frequent occurrence; and that the great majority
of the human race (outside of a few places in
Germany, where waiting mortuaries are established, or
where the police regulations, such as those described
in this volume as existing in Würtemburg, are
efficiently and systematically carried out) are liable to
this catastrophe. Important as the subject is allowed
to be, and numerous as are the reported cases, no
effective steps, either public or private, appear to have
been taken, outside of Germany and Austria, to remedy
the evil. At present a majority of the people appear
content to trust to the judgment of their relations
and to the ordinary certificates of death to safeguard
them from so terrible a disaster. That death-certificates
and death-verifications are often of a
most perfunctory description, both as to the fact of
death and the cause of death, has been proved by
overwhelming evidence before the recent House of
Commons Committee on Death-Certification. Such
certificates, when obtained, may be misleading and
untrustworthy; while in many cases burials take place
without the doctor having either attended the patient or
examined the body. Nor, in spite of the appointment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
of death-verificators by our neighbours across the
Channel, is this important precaution effectively carried
out by them. M. Devergie reports that in twenty-five
thousand communes in France no verification of
death takes place, although the law requires it; and
he demands that no diploma shall be given without
the candidate having proved himself conversant with
the signs of death. (<i>Medical Times</i>, London, 1874,
vol. i., p. 25.) On personal inquiry from medical
authorities in France, during the present year (1896),
we learn that this laxity still prevails.</p>

<p>It appears strange that, except when a man dies, all
his concerns are protected by custom and formalities, or
guarded by laws, so as to insure his interests being
fairly carried out to completion. Thus we see that
heirship, marriage, business affairs of all kinds, whether
of a public or private nature, are amply guarded by
such precautionary and authoritative measures as will
secure them. But one of the most important of all
human interests&mdash;that which relates to the termination
of life&mdash;is managed in such a careless and perfunctory
way as to permit of irreparable mistakes. To be sure
there are laws in most of the Continental States of
Europe that are intended to regulate the care and burial
of the dead, but few of them make it certain that the
apparently dead shall not be mistaken for the really dead,
and treated as such. None of them allow more than
seventy-two hours before burial (some allow only thirty-six,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
others twenty-four, and others again much less,
according to the nature of the disease), unless the attending
physician petitions the authorities for reasonable
delay&mdash;a rare occurrence. And even if postponement
is granted, it is doubtful if the inevitable administrative
formalities would leave opportunities for dubious cases
to receive timely and necessary attention, or for cases of
trance, catalepsy, coma, or the like, to be rescued from a
living burial.</p>

<p>In the introduction to a Treatise entitled “The
Uncertainty of the Signs of Death, and the Danger
of Precipitate Interments,” published in 1746, the
author, Mr. M. Cooper, surgeon, says:&mdash;“Though death
at some time or other is the necessary and unavoidable
portion of human nature, yet it is not
always certain that persons taken for dead are really
and irretrievably deprived of life, since it is evident
from experience that many apparently dead have
afterwards proved themselves alive by rising from
their shrouds, their coffins, and even from their graves.
It is equally certain that some persons, too soon
interred after their supposed decease, have in their
graves fallen victims to a death which might otherwise
have been prevented, but which they then find
more cruel than that procured by the rope or the
rack.” The author quotes Lancisi, first physician to
Pope Clement XI., who, in his Treatise <i>De subitaneis
mortibus</i>, observes:&mdash;“Histories and relations are not
the only proofs which convince me that many persons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
supposed to be dead have shown themselves alive,
even when they were ready to be buried, since I am
induced to such a belief from what I myself have
seen; for I saw a person of distinction, now alive,
recover sensation and motion when the priest was
performing the funeral service over him in church.”</p>

<p>After reporting and describing a large number of
cases of premature burial, or of narrow escapes
from such terrible occurrences, in which the victims
of hasty diagnosis were prepared for burial, or revived
during the progress of the burial service, Mr. Cooper
continues:&mdash;“Now, if a multiplicity of instances evince
that many have the good fortune to escape being
interred alive, it is justly to be suspected that a far
greater number have fallen victims to a fatal confinement
in their graves. But because human nature
is such a slave to prejudice, and so tied down by
the fetters of custom, it is highly difficult, if not
absolutely impossible, to put people on their guard
against such terrible accidents, or to persuade those
vested with authority to take proper measures for
preventing them.”</p>

<p>Nothing seems to have been done to remedy this
serious evil; and forty-two years later Mr. Chas. Kite,
a well-known practitioner, called attention to the subject
in a volume, entitled “The Recovery of the
Apparently Dead,” London, 1788. This author, on p.
92, says:&mdash;“Many, various, and even opposite appearances
have been supposed to indicate the total extinction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
of life. Formerly, a stoppage of the pulse
and respiration were thought to be unequivocal signs
of death; particular attention in examining the state
of the heart and larger arteries, the flame of a taper,
a lock of wool, or a mirror applied to the mouth or
nostrils, were conceived sufficient to ascertain these
points; <i>and great has been the number of those who
have fallen untimely victims to this erroneous opinion</i>.
Some have formed their prognostic from the livid,
black, and cadaverous countenance; others from the
heavy, dull, fixed, or flaccid state of the eyes; from
the dilated pupil; the foaming at the mouth and
nostrils, the rigid and inflexible state of the body,
jaws, or extremities; the intense and universal cold,
etc. Some, conceiving any one of these symptoms as
incompetent and inadequate to the purpose, have
required the presence of such of them as were, in
their opinion, the least liable to error; but whoever
will take the trouble of reading the Reports of the
(Humane) Society with attention, will meet with very
many instances where all the appearances separately,
and even where several associated in the same case,
occurred, and yet the patient recovered; and it is
therefore evident that these signs will not afford
certain and unexceptionable criteria by which we may
distinguish between life and death.”</p>

<p>Mr. Kite furnishes references to numerous cases of
recovery where the apparently dead exhibited black,
livid, or cadaverous countenances; eyes fixed or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
obscure; eyeballs diminished in size, immovable and
fixed in their sockets, the cornea without lustre; eyes
shrivelled; froth at the mouth; rigidity of the body,
jaws, and extremities; partial or universal cold.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>The crux of the whole question is the uncertainty
of the signs which announce the cessation of physical
existence. Prizes have been offered, and prizes have
been awarded, but further experience has shown that
the signs and tests, sometimes singly and sometimes
in combination, have been untrustworthy, and that
the only certain and unfailing sign of death is decomposition.</p>

<p>Commenting upon actual cases of premature burial,
the <i>Lancet</i>, March 17, 1866, p. 295, says:&mdash;“Truly there
is something about the very notion of such a fate
calculated to make one shudder, and to send a cold
stream down one’s spine. By such a catastrophe is not
meant the sudden avalanche of earth, bricks, or stones
upon the luckless miner or excavator, or the crushing,
suffocative death from tumbling ruins. No; it is the
cool, determined treatment of a living being as if he
were dead&mdash;the rolling him in his winding sheet, the
screwing him down in his coffin, the weeping at his
funeral, and the final lowering of him into the narrow
grave, and piling upon his dark and box-like dungeon
loads of his mother earth. The last footfall departs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
from the solitary church-yard, leaving the entranced
sleeper behind in his hideous shell soon to awaken to
consciousness and to a benumbed half-suffocated existence
for a few minutes; or else, more horrible still, there
he lies beneath the ground conscious of what has been
and still is, until, by some fearful agonised struggle of
the inner man at the weird phantasmagoria which has
passed across his mental vision, he awakes to a bodily
vivification as desperate in its torment for a brief period
as has been that of his physical activity. But it is
soon past. There is scarcely room to turn over in the
wooden chamber; and what can avail a few shrieks and
struggles of a half-stifled, cramped-up man!”</p>

<p>To prevent such unspeakable horrors as are here
pictured, the Egyptians kept the bodies of the dead under
careful supervision by the priests until satisfied that
life was extinct, previous to embalming them by means
of antiseptics, balsams, and odoriferous gums. The
Greeks were aware of the dangers of premature burial,
and cut off fingers before cremation to see whether
life was extinct. In ancient Rome the recurrence of
cases of premature burial had impressed the nation
with the necessity for exercising the greatest caution
in the treatment of the supposed dead; hasty conclusions
were looked upon as criminal, the absence of
breath or heat or a cadaverous appearance were
regarded as uncertain tests, and the supposed dead
were put into warm baths or washed with hot water,
and other means of restoration adopted. Neither in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
the greater part of Europe nor in the United States
are any such means resorted to now, except in the
case of apparent death by drowning, by asphyxia, or
by hanging. Premature burials and narrow escapes are
of almost every-day occurrence, as the narratives in the
newspapers testify; and the complaint made by a surgeon,
Mr. Cooper, a hundred and fifty years ago, that the
evil is perpetuated because we are slaves to prejudice,
and because those vested with authority refuse to take
measures for prevention, remains a serious blot upon
our advanced civilisation. The <i>Spectator</i>, September
14, 1895, commenting upon this unsatisfactory state
of affairs, observes:&mdash;“Burning, drowning, even the
most hideous mutilation under a railway train, is as
nothing compared with burial alive. Strangely enough
this universal horror seems to have produced no desire
to guard against burial alive. We all fear it, and yet
practically no one takes any trouble to avoid the risk
of it happening in his own case, or in that of the rest
of mankind. It would be the simplest thing in the
world to take away all chance of burying alive; and
yet the world remains indifferent, and enjoys its horror
undisturbed by the hope of remedy.”</p>

<p>The authors’ own reasonings, opinions, and conclusions
are here briefly presented; but as the majority of the
public are more or less influenced by authority, it has
been thought advisable to furnish a series of authenticated
facts under the several headings to which they
belong, and to cite the judgments of eminent members<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
of the medical profession who have given special attention
to the subject. The source of difficulty has
been an <i>embarras de richesse</i>, or how from a
mass of material, the extent of which will be seen by
reference to the Bibliography, to select typical cases
without needless repetition. The premature burials
and narrow escapes from such disasters, which are
reported by distinguished physicians and reputable
writers, may be numbered literally by hundreds, and
for every one reported it is obvious from the nature
of the case that many are never heard of. Amongst
the names of notable persons who have thought the
subject sufficiently practical for their attention may be
mentioned those of Empedocles, Plato, Aristotle, Cicero,
Pliny, Celsus, Plutarch, and St. Augustine in antiquity;
of Fabricius, Lancisi, Winslow, Haller, Buffon, Lavater,
Moses Mendelssohn, Hufeland, and Alexander von
Humboldt in modern times.</p>

<p>The subject has several times engaged the attention
of the French Senate and Legislative Chamber, as
well as the Legislative Assemblies in the various
States of Germany. In 1871, Dr. Alex. Wilder, Prof.
of Physiology and Psychological Science, read a
paper before the members of both houses of the
New York State Legislature at the Capitol, Albany;
but we are not aware that the subject has ever been
introduced in any of the other State Legislatures, or in
the British Parliament, or in any of the Colonial
Assemblies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>In an editorial note, as far back as November 27, 1858,
the <i>Lancet</i>, referring to a case of death-trance, remarked
that such “examples are sufficiently mysterious
in their character to call for a more careful investigation
than it has hitherto been possible to accord to
them.” The facts disclosed in this treatise, the authors
hope, may encourage qualified scientific observers to
study the subject of death-trance, which, it must be
admitted, has been strangely overlooked in England,
though it would not be easy to mention one which
more deeply concerns every individual born into the
world.</p>

<p>In order to prevent unnecessary pain to the reader
on a subject so distressing in its nature, the more sensational
and horrifying cases of premature burial have
been omitted. They can, however, be found in abundance
in the writings of Bruhier, Köppen, Kempner,
Lénormand, Bouchut, Russell Fletcher, and the Boston
(U.S.) edition of Hartmann. In England and in America
it is the fashion amongst medical men to maintain that
the tests known to medical art are fully equal to the
prevention of live burial, that the cases quoted by the
newspapers are introduced for sensational purposes, and
that most of them are apocryphal. The perusal of the
cases recorded in this volume, and a careful consideration
of the weight of cumulative evidence represented
by the very full bibliography, must satisfy the majority
of reflective readers that the facts are both authentic
and numerous.</p>

to a premature burial; the laws which control them
have perplexed pathologists in all ages, and appear to
be as insoluble as those which govern life itself. Dr.
Le Clerc, in his “History of Medicine,” records that

causes of diseases</i>, and another <i>concerning the disease in

<p>Dr. Herbert Mayo, in “Letters on Truths Contained
in Popular Superstitions,” p. 34, says that “death-trance
is the suspension of the action of the heart, and of
breathing, and of voluntary motion&mdash;generally little
sense of feeling and intelligence. With these phenomena
is joined loss of external warmth, so that the
usual evidence of life is gone. But there has occurred
every shade of this condition that can be imagined,
between occasional slight manifestations of suspension
of one or other of the vital actions and their entire
disparition.”</p>

<p>Macnish, who also asserts that the function of the
heart must go on, and even of the respiration, however
slightly, says&mdash;“No affection to which the animal frame
is subject is more remarkable than this (catalepsy, or
trance).... There is such an apparent extinction of
every faculty essential to life, that it is inconceivable
how existence should go on during the continuance of
the fit.”&mdash;<i>Philos. of Sleep, Glasgow, 1834, pp. 225-6.</i></p>

<p>In Quain’s “Dictionary of Medicine,” ii., p. 1063,
Dr. Gowers says:&mdash;“The state now designated hypnotism
is really induced trance, and trance has been
accurately termed ‘spontaneous hypnotism’....</p>

<p>“The mental functions seem, in most cases, to be in
complete abeyance. No manifestations of consciousness
can be observed, or elicited by the most powerful
cutaneous stimulation, and on recovery no recollection
of the state is preserved. But in some cases volition
only is lost, and the patient is aware of all that passes,
although unable to give the slightest evidence of consciousness....</p>

<p>“In the cases in which the depression of the vital<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
functions reaches an extreme degree, the patient appears
dead to casual and sometimes to careful observation.
This condition has been termed ‘death-trance,’ and
has furnished the theme for many sensational stories,
but the most ghastly incidents of fiction have been
paralleled by well-authenticated facts. [The last clause
appears in the new edition as follows:&mdash;“Persons have
certainly been buried in this state, and during the
recent epidemic of influenza an Italian narrowly escaped
interment during the consequent trance.”]</p>

<p>“The duration of trance has varied from a few hours
or days to several weeks, months, or even a year.</p>

<p>“Occasionally it is attended by some vaso-motor
disturbance. In a well-authenticated case of death-trance
the intense mental excitement produced by the
preparations for fastening the coffin lid occasioned a
sweat to break out over the body.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">CASE OF BENJAMIN DISRAELI.</div>

<p>Many notable men have at one time or another been
subject to this disorder. Speaking of Benjamin Disraeli,
Mr. J. Fitzgerald Molloy, in his “Life of the Gorgeous
Lady Blessington,” vol. ii., pp. 37, 38, says that in his “youth
he was seized with fits of giddiness, during which the world
swung round him, he became abstracted, and once fell
into a trance from which he did not recover for a week.”</p>

<p class="psh">LETHARGIC STUPOR, OR TRANCE.</p>

<p>The <i>Lancet</i> of December 22, 1883, pp. 1078-80,
contains particulars from the pen of W. T. Gairdner,
M.D., LL.D., etc., Professor of Medicine in the University
of Glasgow, of a remarkable case of trance, extending
continuously over more than twenty-three weeks, which
attracted a considerable amount of notoriety at the time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
and led to an extensive discussion. In his comments
upon the case, the author continues, in the issue of
January 5, 1884, pp. 5, 6:&mdash;</p>

<p>“The case recorded in the <i>Lancet</i> of December 22,
1883, p. 1078, has been left up to this point without
remarks, other than those obviously suggested by the
direct observation of the facts in comparison or contrast
with those of other cases coming more or less under the
designation above mentioned. But in perusing, even in
the most cursory manner, the multitudinous literature
pertaining to the subjects of ‘trance,’ ‘ecstasy,’ ‘catalepsy,’
etc., not to speak of the popular narratives which
from a very remote antiquity have handed down the
tradition of preternatural sleep as an element in the fairy
tales of almost all languages, one is struck by the
almost uncontrollable disposition to regard such cases
as altogether outside the limits of true physiological
science: as being, according to the expressive Scotch
phrase, ‘no canny’&mdash;or, in other words, miraculous&mdash;and
as involving questions connected with the unseen
world, ‘the undiscovered country from whose bourn no
traveller returns.’ So much is this the case, that, if in
this nineteenth century the questions which presented
themselves to Hippocrates in the treatise, <i>περὶ ἱερῆς νούσου</i>
(‘Concerning the Sacred Disease’), had to be rediscussed,
it would certainly be in regard to some of the
disorders mentioned above, and not as to epilepsy
in its well-recognised clinical types, that the theory of a
supernatural origin of the phenomena, whether favourably
entertained or not, would fall to be argued. The
irreconcilable differences of opinion in the Belgium
Academy, as regards the quite modern instance of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
Louise Lateau, are sufficient to show that all the culture
and the scientific instincts of the present age have
not quite inaugurated the ‘reign of law,’ nor established
finally the position that ‘miracles do not happen.’ On
the other hand, the researches of M. Charcot and others
seem to be ever extending the domain of science
further into the region of the marvellous and the
obscure, so that even the most pronounced cases of
‘demoniac possession’ of the olden time have become
the commonplaces of hystero-epilepsy in the clinique
of the Salpétrière. The peculiar interest of the present
case is that it is altogether devoid of any of these
adventitious, and more or less romantic, incidents. The
patient is the mother of a family, and has lived a strictly
domestic and (up to a short time before her seizure)
healthy and regular life. There are no peculiar moral
and religious problems to perplex the situation. There
is no history of inveterate hysteria, or of long continued
rapt contemplation; nor has there been the slightest
evidence of any craving after notoriety, either before
the attack or since its termination. The moral atmosphere,
in short, surrounding the phenomena is altogether
unfavourable to exaggeration and imposture, for which,
indeed, no reasonable motive can be assigned. Nevertheless,
under these very commonplace conditions, concurring
with some degree of melancholy or mental
despondency after delivery, but during a convalescence
otherwise normal, Mrs. M’I&mdash;&mdash; presents to our notice
a condition of suspended consciousness and disordered
innervation in no degree less extreme than the ‘trances’
or cataleptic attacks which have been recorded as the
result of the most aggravated hysteria, or as the miracles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
of religious ecstasy and profound mental emotion. She
becomes for the long period of over a hundred and sixty
days continuously an almost mindless automaton, connected
with the external world only through a few
insignificant reflexes and through the organic functions.
She is absolutely passive as regards everything that
demands spontaneous movement, and betrays almost
no sign of sensation, general or special, when subjected
to the severest tests that can be applied short of physical
injury.”</p>

<p>In further notes upon the case, in the <i>Lancet</i> of
January 12, 1884, p. 58, Professor Gairdner says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“The only other case to which I desire to make allusion at
present is one in which I am, fortunately, in a position to furnish
a sequel to an incomplete narrative, not without resemblance to
the one lately published in this journal.<span class="sidenote1"><span class="lmid">CASE REPORTED BY PROF. W. T. GAIRDNER.</span></span> ‘A Case of Trance’ was the
subject of a paragraph in the <i>British Medical Journal</i> of May 31,
1879, p. 827, from which it appeared that in the London Hospital
a woman, twenty-seven years of age, was at the time under the
care of Dr. Langdon Down, being of rather small stature and
weak mental capacity, and affected for at least two years with
organic disease of the heart. About three weeks before the date
of the report she had become suddenly somnolent, with most of
the peculiarities in her sleep which have been already alluded to.
She was fed partly by nutrient enemata, and for some days by a
tube passed through the nostrils into the stomach. The resemblance
is noted between this case and that of ‘the famous Welsh
fasting girl,’ then attracting much attention in newspapers and
otherwise. There being no further reference to this case in the
journal, I wrote to Dr. Langdon Down, who kindly furnished me
with the following additional particulars, which will, no doubt, be
read even now with interest:&mdash;‘My patient, who was in a state of
trance, recovered somewhat suddenly after about four weeks, and
left the hospital. The first indication of returning consciousness
was observed when I was reading to my class at her bedside one
of the numerous letters that I had received entreating me not to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
have her buried until something which the writers recommended
had been done. The paragraph of the medical journal got into
some Welsh paper, and then went the round of the provincial press,
hence the number of letters I received. This special one was
from an old gentleman of eighty-four years, who, when he was
twenty-four, was thought to be dead, and whose friends had
assembled to follow him to the grave, when he heard the undertaker
say, “Would anyone like to see the corpse before I screw him
down?” The undertaker at the same time moved the head a little
and struck it against the coffin, on which he aroused and sat up.
On reading this aloud a visible smile passed over the face of my
patient, and she returned to obvious consciousness soon after.
She has not come under observation since she left the hospital.’</p></div>

<p class="p1">“Although this case is probably only one among many,
I mention it here because the receipt of the letter just
given led me to investigate more particularly the state
of the hearing in Mrs. M’I.’s case, and also to try the
experiment of reading aloud Dr. Down’s letter in her
presence and that of the class. I had often remarked
to bystanders that, although the subjects of these apparently
unconscious states appeared inaccessible to the
ordinary tests of sensibility, it was on record as regards
some, even of those regarded as cases of ‘apparent
death,’ that after recovery they affirm to have heard
everything that passed, although unable to lift hand or
foot to save themselves from premature burial. Neither
the reading of the letter nor a violent shout into her ear
produced any visible effects.”</p>

<p>Thomas More Madden, M.D., F.R.C.S. (Edin.), in an
article on “Death’s Counterfeit,” in the <i>Medical Press
and Circular</i>, vol. i., April 27, 1887, pp. 386-8, relates the
following case “of so-called hysteric trance”:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“A young lady, Miss R&mdash;&mdash;, apparently in perfect health, went
to her room after luncheon to make some change in her dress.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
A few minutes afterwards she was found lying on her bed in a
profound sleep, from which she could not be awakened. When I
first saw her, twenty-four hours later, she was sleeping tranquilly;
the decubitus being dorsal, respiration scarcely perceptible, pulse
seventy, and extremely small; her face was pallid, lips motionless,
and the extremities very cold.<span class="sidenote1"><span class="lmid">DEATH’S COUNTERFEIT.</span></span> At this moment, so death-like was
her aspect, that a casual observer might have doubted the possibility
of the vital spark still lingering in that apparently inanimate
frame, on which no external stimulus seemed to produce any
sensorial impression, with the exception that the pupils were
normal and responded to light. Sinapisms were applied over the
heart and to the legs, where they were left on until vesication was
occasioned without causing any evidence of pain. Faradisation
was also resorted to without effect. In this state she remained
from the evening of December 31 until the afternoon of January 3,
when the pulse became completely imperceptible; the surface of
the body was icy cold, the respiratory movements apparently
ceased, and her condition was to all outward appearance undistinguishable
from death. Under the influence of repeated
hypodermic injections of sulphuric ether and other remedies,
however, she rallied somewhat, and her pulse and temperature
improved. But she still slept on until the morning of the 9th,
when she suddenly woke up, and, to the great astonishment of
those about her, called for her clothes, which had been removed
from their ordinary place, and wanted to come down to breakfast,
without the least consciousness of what had occurred. Her
recovery, I may add, was rapid and complete.</p>

<p>“The next case of lethargy that came under my notice was that
of a boy, who, after an attack of fever, fell into a state of complete
lethargic coma, in which he lay insensible between life and death
for forty-seven days, and ultimately recovered perfectly.</p>

<p>“In a third instance of the same kind, in a lady under my care,
the patient, after a lethargic sleep of twenty-seven days, recovered
consciousness for a few hours, and then relapsed into her former
comatose condition, in which she died.</p>

<p>“The fourth case of lethargy which I have seen was, like the
first, a case of trance, which lasted for seventy hours, during
which the flickering vital spark was only preserved from extinction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
by the involuntary action of the spinal and nervous centres. In
this instance the patient finally recovered.</p>

<p>“The fifth and last instance of profound lethargy that has come
within my own observation occurred last autumn in the Mater Misericordiæ
Hospital in a young woman.... In that instance, despite
all that medical skill could suggest or unremitting attention could do,
it was found impossible to arouse the patient from the apparently
hysterical lethargic sleep in which she ultimately sank and died.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">I have referred to the foregoing cases, occurring in
one physician’s experience, as disproving the general
opinion that lethargy or trance is so rarely met with as
to be of little medical importance. For my own part,
I have no doubt that these conditions are of far more
frequent occurrence than is generally supposed. Moreover,
I have had reason to know that death is occasionally
so exactly thus counterfeited that there is good
cause for fearing the probability of living interment in
some cases of hasty burial.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DR. MORE MADDEN’S OPINION.</div>

<p>Referring to death-trance, Dr. Madden observes, <i>ib.</i>,
p. 388&mdash;“Death-trance, or that profound degree of lethargy
which closely counterfeits death, deserves greater
attention than is generally paid to it as a pathological
condition, as well as a possible cause of premature
interment. For, unless we reject every statement,
however well authenticated, of those who have witnessed
such cases, merely because their experience does
not tally with our preconceived opinions and wishes,
neither the frequent occurrence of death-trance nor the
fearful results of its non-recognition can be questioned.”</p>

<p>Mr. John Chippendale, F.R.C.S., writing to the <i>Lancet</i>,
1889, vol. i., p. 1173, on “Catalepsy.&mdash;Post-mortem
Sweating,” says:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“I may mention that there is a record of a man who during an
illness was seized with trance, though, as he lay in what Claudio<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
calls ‘cold abstraction,’ he was aware of all that was passing. At
last, as he was about to be covered in his coffin, his mental condition
was such that he broke into a profuse sweat, which was
fortunately perceived, and he recovered and was able to recount
his experiences.”</p>

<p class="p1">It would appear from the following telegram through
Reuter’s Agency that trance is occasionally epidemic:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pc">“A NEW DISEASE.</p>

<p class="pr2">“Vienna, March 15, 1890.</p>

<p>“Several cases of a new disease, which originally appeared in
Mantua immediately after the subsidence of the recent influenza
epidemic, and to which the people of that city gave the name of
‘La nonna’&mdash;<i>Anglice</i>, ‘Falling asleep’&mdash;have occurred in the
Comitat of Pressburg.</p>

<p>“Persons suffering from this complaint fall into a death-like
trance, lasting about four days, out of which the patient wakes in a
state of intense exhaustion. Recovery is very slow, but, so far, no
fatal case has been reported.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">A correspondent writing to the <i>English Mechanic</i>
September 13, 1895, says:&mdash;“I know one lady who has
been three times prepared for burial, and very narrowly
escaped it on the first occasion.” The author wrote to
the writer for further details, and received a reply, dated
September 19, 1895, from which it appears that the lady
had married into a political family of considerable note,
who would not care to have her identity disclosed. My
correspondent says:&mdash;“ I know that she lay several days
in a state not to be distinguished from death; that she
was in her coffin, and, I believe, showed signs of life just
as the coffin was about to be closed. On two subsequent
occasions she passed into similar trances; but though
believed to be dead, and treated as such, the previous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
experience prevented any idea of burial being entertained”
until clear evidence of dissolution should
appear.</p>

<p>The <i>New York Weekly Witness</i> of January 15, 1896,
reports</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="pc1">“A LONG CATALEPTIC SLEEP</p>

<p>“Information was received at Milford, Pa., last Friday, that
William Depue, a prominent citizen of Bushkill, Pike County,
whose mind for seven years has been a blank, had suddenly returned
to consciousness.</p>

<div class="sidenote1">A SEVEN YEARS’ TRANCE.</div>

<p>“Seven years ago, while at work, Mr. Depue became ill.
Doctors were summoned, but they could find no possible ailment.
The sick man sank into a cataleptic sleep, from which medical
science could not arouse him.</p>

<p>“At no time during the long period did he recognise any one,
and food was given him through a tube inserted in his mouth.
He lost no flesh, and was apparently as healthy as any man.
Although the best medical men in the country were called to his
bedside, his case baffled them all.</p>

<p>“Upon recovering his senses he set about his usual labours as if
he had been asleep but the ordinary time. He remembers nothing
that has taken place during his seven years’ trance.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">The following case appeared in the <i>Middlesbrough
Daily Gazette</i>, February 9, 1896, and in a number of
English papers:&mdash;</p>


<p class="pbq p1">“The young Dutch maiden, Maria Cvetskens, who now lies
asleep at Stevensworth, has beaten the record in the annals of
somnolence. At the beginning of last month she had been asleep
for nearly three hundred days. The doctors, who visit her in great
numbers, are agreed that there is no deception in the case. Her
parents are of excellent repute, and it has never occurred to them
to make any financial profit out of the abnormal state of their
daughter. As to the cause of the prolonged sleep, the doctors
differ.”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p class="pch">CATALEPSY.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Catalepsy</span> differs in some of its characteristics from
trance, but the one is often mistaken for the other. It
is not so much a disease as a symptom of certain
nervous disorders, and to which women and children
are more particularly liable. Catalepsy can be produced
artificially by hypnotisation. Like trance, it has often
been mistaken for death, and its subjects buried alive.</p>

<p>Dr. Franz Hartmann differentiates the two disorders
as follows:&mdash;“There seems hardly any limit to the time
during which a person may remain in a trance; but
catalepsy is due to some obstruction in the organic
mechanism of the body, on account of its exhausted
nervous power. In the last case the activity of life
begins again as soon as the impediment is removed, or
the nervous energy has recuperated its strength.”</p>

<p>Dr. Gowers, in Quain’s “Dictionary of Medicine,” ed.
1894, vol. i., pp. 284-5, describes catalepsy as belonging
to both sexes, at all ages from six to sixty. It is
a nervous affection, commonly associated with distinct
evidence of hysteria, but said sometimes to occur as an
early symptom of epilepsy. It is attended commonly
with loss of consciousness. The limbs remain in the
position they occupied at the onset, as if petrified.
The whole or part of the muscles pass into a state of
rigidity. In profound conditions sensibility is lost to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
touch, pain, and electricity; and no reflex movements
can be induced even by touching the conjunctiva, a state
of mental trance being associated.</p>

<div class="sidenote">NATURE OF CATALEPSY.</div>

<p><i>Cassell’s Family Physician</i> (by Physicians and Surgeons
of the principal London Hospitals) describes this
singular affection, as follows:&mdash;“Catalepsy is one of the
strangest diseases possible. It is of rare occurrence, and
some very sceptical people have even gone so far as to
deny its existence. That is all nonsense, for catalepsy
is just as much a reality as gout or bronchitis. A fit
of catalepsy&mdash;for it is a paroxysmal disease&mdash;consists
essentially in the sudden suspension of thought, feeling,
and the power of moving. The patient remains in
any position in which she&mdash;we say she, for it occurs
mostly in women&mdash;happens to be at the moment of the
seizure, and will, moreover, retain any posture in which
she may be placed during the continuance of the fit.
For example, you may stretch out the arms to their
full length, and there they remain stretched out without
showing the slightest tendency to drop. It does not
matter how absurd or inconvenient or apparently
fatiguing the position may be, it is maintained until
altered by some one or until the fit is over. In these
attacks there are no convulsions, but, on the contrary,
the patient remains perfectly immobile. She is just like
a waxen figure, or an inanimate statue, or a frozen
corpse.</p>

<p>“Cataleptic fits vary very much, not only in their frequency,
but in their duration. Sometimes they are
very short indeed, lasting only a few minutes. In one
case, that of a lady, they would sometimes come on
when she was reading aloud. She would stop suddenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
in the middle of a sentence, and a peculiar stiffness of
the whole body would seize her, fixing the limbs immovably
for several minutes. Then it would pass off,
and the reading would be continued at the very word
at which it had been interrupted, the patient being
quite unconscious that anything had happened. But
sometimes fits such as these may last for days and
days together, and it seems not improbable that people
may have been buried in this state in mistake for
death.”</p>

<p>The following case, contributed by Dr. Gooch, will
further illustrate this malady:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“A lady, who laboured habitually under melancholy, a few days
after parturition was seized with catalepsy, and presented the
following appearances:&mdash;She was lying in bed motionless and
apparently senseless. It was thought the pupils of her eyes were
dilated, and some apprehensions were entertained of effusion on
the brain; but on examining them closely it was found they
readily contracted when the light fell upon them. The only signs
of life were warmth, and a pulse which was one hundred and
twenty, and weak. In attempting to rouse her from this senseless
state, the trunk of the body was lifted up and placed so far back
as to form an obtuse angle with the lower extremities, and in this
posture, with nothing to support her, she continued sitting for
many minutes. One arm was now raised, and then the other, and
in the posture they were placed they remained. It was a curious
sight to see her sitting up staring lifelessly, her arms outstretched,
yet without any visible signs of animation. She was very thin
and pallid, and looked like a corpse that had been propped up
and stiffened in that attitude. She was now taken out of bed and
placed upright, and attempts were made to rouse her by calling
loudly in her ears, but in vain; she stood up, indeed, but as
inanimate as a statue. The slightest push put her off her balance,
and she made no exertion to retain it, and would have fallen had
she not been caught. She went into this state three times; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
first lasted fourteen hours, the second twelve hours, and the third
nine hours, with waking intervals of three days after the first fit,
and of one day after the second; after this time the disease
assumed the ordinary form of melancholia.&mdash;<i>The Science and
Practice of Medicine, by Sir W. Aitken, p. 357.</i></p></div>

<div class="sidenote">CASES BY DRS. JEBB AND KING CHAMBERS.</div>

<p class="p1">Dr. John Jebb, F.R.S., cited in Reynolds’ “System of
Medicine,” vol. ii., pp. 99-102, has recorded the following
graphic case:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“In the latter end of last year (<i>viz.</i>, 1781), I was desired to visit
a young lady who, for nine months, had been afflicted with that
singular disorder termed a catalepsy. Although she was prepared
for my visit, she was seized with the disorder as soon as my arrival
was announced. She was employed in netting, and was passing
the needle through the mesh, in which position she immediately
became rigid, exhibiting, in a very pleasing form, a figure of death-like
sleep, beyond the power of art to imitate or the imagination
to conceive. Her forehead was serene, her features perfectly
composed. The paleness of her colour, her breathing at a distance
being also scarcely perceptible, operated in rendering the
similitude to marble more exact and striking. The positions of
her fingers, hands, and arms were altered with difficulty, but they
preserved every form of flexure they acquired: nor were the
muscles of the neck exempted from this law, her head maintaining
every situation in which the hand could place it as firmly as
her limbs,” etc.</p>

<p class="p1">Dr. King Chambers, after citing the above case in
full, continues:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“The most common exciting cause of catalepsy seems to be
strong mental emotion. When Covent Garden Theatre was last
burnt down, the blaze flashed in at the uncurtained windows of
St. Mary’s Hospital. One of my patients, a girl of twenty,
recovering from low fever, was woke up by it, and exclaimed that
the day of judgment was come. She remained in an excited
state all night, and the next morning grew gradually stiff, like a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
corpse, whispering (before she became quite insensible) that she
was dead. If her arm was raised, it remained extended in the
position in which it was placed for several minutes, and then
slowly subsided. The inelastic kind of way in which it retained
its position for a time, and then gradually yielded to the force of
gravity, reminded one more of a wax figure than of the marble
to which Dr. Jebb compares it. A strange effect was produced
by opening the eyelid of one eye; the other eye remained closed,
and the raised lid after a time fell very slowly like the arm. A
better superficial representation of death it is difficult to conceive....
In both these cases I convinced myself carefully that
there was no deception.</p>

<p>“Other cases are of much longer duration.... The death-like
state may last for days. It may be mistaken for real death,
and treated as such....</p>

<p>“Any cases of apparent death that did occur (in former days)
were burnt, or buried, or otherwise put out of the way, and
were never more heard of. But after the establishment of
Christianity, tenderness, sometimes excessive, for the remains of
departed friends took the place of the hard, heathen selfishness.
The dead were kept closer to the congregations of the living,
as if to represent in material form the dogma of the Communion
of Saints. This led to the discovery that some persons, indeed
some persons of note (amongst others, Duns Scotus the theologian,
at Cologne), had got out of their coffins, and died in a vain
attempt to open the doors of their vaults.”</p></div>

<p class="p2">The author relates several other remarkable cases.
Here is one:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“I lighted accidently on another case, communicated to the
same scientific body (Acad. Royale des Sciences), by M. Imbert
in 1713. It is that of the driver of the Rouen diligence, aged
forty-five, who fell into a kind of soporific catalepsy on hearing
of the sudden death of a man he had quarrelled with. It appears
that ‘M. Burette, under whose care he was at La Charité, made
use of the most powerful assistances of art&mdash;bleeding in the arms,
the foot, the neck, emetics, purgatives, blisters, leeches,’ etc. At<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
last somebody ‘threw him naked into cold water to surprise him.’
The effect surprised the doctors as much as the patient. It is
related with evident wonder how that ‘he opened his eyes, looked
steadfastly, but did not speak.’ His wife seems to have been a
prudent woman, for a week afterwards she ‘carried him home,
where he is at present: they gave him no medicine; he speaks
sensibly enough, and mends every day.’”</p>

<div class="sidenote">CASES FROM THE MEDICAL JOURNALS.</div>

<p class="p1">The <i>Lancet</i>, 1870, vol. i., p. 1044, in its Paris correspondence
says:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“The following curious case is related as having occurred at
Dunkirk, on April 14, and as ‘showing the utility of catalepsy.’
A young girl of seventeen years was seized with a violent attack of
epilepsy, and fell, on the above date, into a canal. A boatman
immediately jumped into the water to save her, and brought her to
the shore after twenty minutes. The most singular circumstance
connected with the accident is that, when the young girl was taken
out of the water, she presented all the symptoms of catalepsy.
Notwithstanding this long immersion, she was resuscitated, and
nothing afterwards transpired to cause any anxiety.”</p>

<p class="p1">Mr. James Braid, M.R.C.S., in the <i>Medical Times</i>,
1850, vol. xxi., p. 402, narrates a case of a cataleptic
woman in the Manchester Royal Infirmary under the
care of Dr. John Mitchell, and writes:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Every variety of contrivance and torture was resorted to by
various parties who saw her, for the purpose of testing the degree
of her insensibility, and for determining whether she might not
be an impostor, but without eliciting the slightest indication of
activity of any of the senses; ... nevertheless she <i>heard and
understood all that was said and proposed to be done, and suffered
the most exquisite torture from various tests applied to her</i>!!
A fact so important as this ought to be published in every journal
throughout the civilised world; so that in future professional men
might be thereby led to exercise greater discretion and mercy in
their modes of applying tests to such patients.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">The <i>Somerset County Herald</i> (Taunton) of October 12
1895, has the following:&mdash;</p>


<div class="pbq">

<p class="pc1">“EXTRAORDINARY CASE OF TRANCE NEAR WEYMOUTH.</p>

<p>“The wedding nuptials of a sailor from H.M.S. <i>Alexandra</i> and
a young woman residing at Broadwey, who were recently married,
have been interrupted in a most unusual manner by the newly-made
bride falling into a trance. On the day following the
wedding Mr. and Mrs. Mortimer, for such is the name of the
newly-espoused pair, went for a drive, and on returning in the
evening the bride, remarking that she did not feel very well, went
upstairs, and before long was in a sound sleep, which continued
throughout the night and far into the following day. The relatives
of the bride, remembering symptoms which she had previously
developed, then sent for Dr. Pridham, who at once pronounced
that the unfortunate young woman had fallen into a trance. Dr.
Colmer, of Weymouth, was likewise called; but nothing that these
two medical gentlemen could do had the slightest effect in arousing
their patient from the state of lethargy into which she had so
suddenly and unexpectedly relapsed. In this condition she remained
for a space of five days, when she gradually showed signs
of returning animation, and in the course of a few hours regained
consciousness, though she was then in a very exhausted condition.
After her awakening the young woman developed inflammation of
the legs, which was regarded as a very serious condition for her to
be in. In an interview on Saturday, Dr. Pridham described the
trance as being exceedingly death-like in character, and added
that, in such trances as the one in question, in the past people
have no doubt been actually buried.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">A report of this case appears in the <i>St. James’s
Gazette</i>.</p>

<p>A less experienced practitioner would probably have
made out a death certificate, as in numerous similar
cases.</p>

<p>After burial we hear no more of them; they may
have been buried in a death-like trance, but the medical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
certificate, no matter how inconsiderately given, consigns
them to perpetual silence beyond appeal or escape.
Family remonstrance is then unavailing, for, except
in cases of strong suspicion of poisoning, no Home
Secretary or Coroner would grant an order for exhumation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">APATHY OF THE PUBLIC.</div>

<p>The existence of trance, catalepsy, and other death
counterfeits, followed by hasty burial, has been alluded
to by reputable writers from time immemorial; and
while the veracity of these writers has remained unchallenged,
and their narratives are confirmed by hundreds
of cases of modern experience, the effect on the
public mind has been only of a transitory character,
and nothing has been done either in England or
America to safeguard the people from such dreadful
mistakes.</p>

<p class="pch">ANIMAL AND SO-CALLED HUMAN HIBERNATION.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> following case of the jerboa, or jumping mouse,
recorded last century by Major-General Thomas Davies,
F.R.S., in the “Transactions of the Linnæan Society,”<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
will show how far a torpid mammal may be removed
from the opportunity of breathing, and how imperceptibly,
to the eyes of an observer, its torpid life passed
into actual death:&mdash;</p>

<p>“With respect to the figure given of it in its dormant
state (plate viii., fig. 6), I have to observe that the
specimen was found by some workmen in digging the
foundation for a summer house in a gentleman’s garden,
about two miles from Quebec, in the latter end of May,
1787. It was discovered enclosed in a ball of clay,
about the size of a cricket ball, nearly an inch in thickness,
perfectly smooth within, and about twenty inches
under ground. The man who first discovered it, not
knowing what it was, struck the ball with his spade, by
which means it was broken to pieces, or the ball also
would have been presented to me. The drawing will
perfectly show how the animal is laid during its dormant
state [a tawny mouse, with long hind legs and
long tail, coiled up into a perfect ovoid, of which the two
poles are the crown of the head and the rump.] How<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
long it had been under ground it is impossible to say;
but as I never could observe these animals in any parts
of the country after the beginning of September, I conceive
that they lay themselves up some time in that
month, or beginning of October, when the frost becomes
sharp; nor did I ever see them again before the last
week of May, or beginning of June. From their being
enveloped in balls of clay, without any appearance of
food, I conceive they sleep during the winter, and remain
for that time without sustenance. As soon as I
conveyed this specimen to my house, I deposited it, as
it was, in a small chip box, in some cotton, waiting with
great anxiety for its waking; but that not taking place
at the season they generally appear, I kept it until I
found it began to smell: I then stuffed it, and preserved
it in its torpid position. I am led to believe its not recovering
from that state arose from the heat of my
room during the time it was in the box, a fire having
been constantly burning in the stove, and which in all
probability was too great for respiration....”</p>

<div class="sidenote">INSTANCES OF ANIMAL HIBERNATION.</div>

<p>Mr. Braid, after citing facts as to higher animals, proceeds:&mdash;“There
are other creatures which have not the
power of migrating from climes too intensely hot for the
normal exercise of their physical functions, and the lives
of these animals are preserved through a state of torpor
superinduced by the want of sufficient moisture, their
bodies being dried up from excessive heat. This is the
case with snails, which are said to have been revived by
a little cold water being thrown on them, after having
remained in a dry and torpid state for fifteen years.
The <i>vibrio tritici</i> has also been restored, after perfect
torpidity and apparent death for five years and eight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
months, by merely soaking it in water. Some small,
microscopic animals have been apparently killed and
revived again a dozen times by drying and then applying
moisture to them. This is remarkably verified in
the case of the wheel-animalcule. And Spallanzani
states that some animalcules have been recovered by
moisture after a torpor of twenty-seven years. According
to Humboldt, again, some large animals are thrown
into a similar state from want of moisture. Such he
states to be the case with the alligator and boa-constrictor
during the dry season in the plains of Venezuela,
and with other animals elsewhere.”&mdash;<i>On Trance and
Human Hibernation, p. 47.</i></p>

<p>Dr. Moore Russell Fletcher, in his treatise on “Suspended
Animation,” pp. 7, 8, observes:&mdash;“Snakes and
toads live for a long time without air or food. The
following experiment was made by a Mr. Tower, of
Gardiner (Maine). An adder, upwards of two feet in
length, was got into a glass jar, which was tightly
sealed. He was kept there for sixteen months without
any apparent change, and when let out, looked as well
as when put in, and crawled away.</p>

<p>“The common pond trout, when thrown into snow,
will soon freeze, remain so for days, and when put into
cold water to remove the frost become lively as ever.</p>

<p>“When residing in New Brunswick, in 1842, we went
to a lake to secure some trout, which were frozen in the
snow and kept for use. While there we saw men with
long wooden tongs catching frost fish from the salt
water at the entrance of a brook. The fish were thrown
upon the ice in great quantities. We had a barrel of
them put up with snow and kept frozen, and in a cool<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
place. For six or seven weeks they were taken out and
used as wanted, and might be kept frozen for an indefinite
time, and be alive when thawed in cold water.
The two pieces of a fish, cut in two when frozen, would
move and try to swim when thawed in cold water.”</p>

<p class="psh">SO-CALLED HUMAN HIBERNATION.</p>

<p>Dr. George Moore observes that “A state of the body
is certainly sometimes produced (in man) which is
nearly analogous to the torpor of the lower animals&mdash;<i>a
condition utterly inexplicable to any principle taught
in the schools</i>. Who, for instance, can inform us how
it happens that certain fishes may be suddenly frozen
in the Polar Sea, and so remain during the long winter
and yet be requickened into full activity by returning
summer?”&mdash;<i>Use of the Body in Relation to the Mind,
p. 31.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">UNCERTAINTY OF DEATH.</div>

<p>Hufeland, in his “Uncertainty of Death,” 1824, p. 12,
observes that it is easier for mankind to fall into a
state of trance than the lower creatures, on account of
their complicated anatomy. It is a transitory state
between life and death, into which anyone may pass
and return from. Trance was common among the
Greeks and Romans, who, just before cremation, had the
custom of cutting off a finger-joint, most probably to
discover if there was any trace of life. Death does not
come suddenly; it is a gradual process from actual life
into apparent death, and from that to actual death. It
is a mistake to take outward appearances for inner death.</p>

<p>“It often happens a person is buried in a trance
knowing all the preparations for the interment, and this
affects him so much that it prolongs the trance by its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
depressing influence. How long can a man exist in a
state of trance? Is there no sign by which the remaining
spark of life may be recognised? Do no means
exist to prevent awakening in the grave? Nothing can
be said as to its duration; but we do know that differences
in the cause and circumstances will cause a difference
in duration. The amount of strength of the person
would have great effect in this. Weak persons, broken
down by excesses, would die sooner than the strong.
The nature of the disease would make a difference.
Old age is less liable to trance than the young. Long
sickness destroys the sources of life, and shortens the
process of death. Sorrow and trouble, and numerous
diseases, seem to bring on death; yet ofttimes the source
of life in them exists to its full extent, and what seems
in them to be death may be only a fainting fit, or cramp,
which temporarily interrupts the action of life. Women
are more liable to trance than men: most cases have
happened in them. Trance may exist in the new-born;
give them time, and many of them revive. The smell
of the earth is at times sufficient to wake up a case of
trance. Six or seven days, or longer, are often required
to restore such cases.” (Extracted from pp. 10-24.)</p>

<p>Mr. Chunder Sen, municipal secretary to the Maharajah
of Jeypore, introduced the author, during his visit
to India, March 8, 1896, to a venerable and learned
fakir, who was seated on a couch Buddhist fashion, the
feet turned towards the stomach, in the attitude of
meditation, in a small but comfortable house near the
entrance to the beautiful public gardens of that city.
The fakir possesses the power of self-induced trance,
which really amounts to a suspension of life, being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
indistinguishable from death. In the month of December,
1895, he passed into and remained in this condition
for twenty days. On several occasions the experiment
has been conducted under test conditions. In 1889,
Dr. Hem Chunder Sen, of Delhi, and his brother,<span class="sidenote">SELF-INDUCED HIBERNATION.</span> Mr.
Chunder Sen, had the opportunity of examining the
fakir while passing into a state of hibernation, and
found that the pulse beat slower and slower until it
ceased to beat at all. The stethoscope was applied to
the heart by the doctor, who failed to detect the slightest
motion. The fakir, covered with a white shroud, was
placed in a small subterraneous cell built of masonry,
measuring about six feet by six feet, of rotund structure.
The door was closed and locked, and the lock sealed with
Dr. Sen’s private seal and with that of Mr. Dhanna Tal,
the magistrate of the city; the flap door leading to the
vault was also carefully fastened. At the expiration
of thirty-three days the cell was opened, and the fakir
was found just where he was placed, but with a death-like
appearance, the limbs having become stiff as in
<i>rigor mortis</i>. He was brought from the vault, and the
mouth was rubbed with honey and milk, and the body
and joints massaged with oil. In the evening, manifestations
of life were exhibited, and the fakir was fed
with a spoonful of milk. The next day he was given
a little juice of pulses known as <i>dal</i>, and in three days
he was able to eat bread and milk, his normal diet.
These cases are well known both at Delhi and at Jeypore,
and the facts have never been disputed. The fakir is a
Sanscrit scholar, and is said to be endowed with much
wisdom, and is consulted by those who are interested in
Hindu learning and religion. He has never received<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
money from visitors, and the mention of it distresses
him.</p>

<p>The <i>Medical Times</i> of May 11, 1850, contains a communication
from Mr. Braid, who says he has “lost no
opportunity of accumulating evidence on this subject,
and that while many alleged feats of this kind are
probably of a deceptive character, still there are others
which admit of no such explanation; and that it becomes
the duty of scientific men fairly to admit the
difficulty.” He then refers to two documents by eye-witnesses
of these feats, and which, he says, “with the
previous evidence on the subject, must set the point at
rest for ever, as to the fact of the feats referred to being
genuine phenomena, deception being impossible.” In
one of these instances, the fakir was buried in the
ground for six weeks, and was, consequently, deprived
not only of food and drink, but also of light and air;
when he was disinterred, his legs and arms were shrivelled
and stiff, but his face was full; no pulse could
be discovered in the heart, temples, or arms. “About
three years since I spent some time with a General
C&mdash;&mdash;, a highly respectable and intelligent man, who
had been a long time in the Indian service, and who
was himself an eye-witness of one of these feats. A
fakir was buried several feet in the earth, under vigilant
inspection, and a watch was set, so that no one could
communicate with him; and to make the matter doubly
sure, corn was sown upon the grave, and during the
time the man was buried, it vegetated and grew to the
height of several inches. He lay there forty-two days.
The gentleman referred to passed the place many times
during his burial, saw the growing corn, was also present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
at his disinterment, and when he questioned the man,
and intimated to him that he thought deception had
been practised, the fakir offered, for a sum of money, to
be buried again, for the same length of time, by the
General himself, and in his own garden. This challenge,
of course, closed the argument.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">CASES REPORTED BY MR. BRAID.</div>

<p>Cases of this kind might be multiplied on evidence
which cannot be doubted, and, in Mr. Braid’s book,
entitled “Human Hibernation,” there are cases fully
stated. Sir Claude Wade, who was an eye-witness of
these feats when acting as political agent at the Court
of Runjeet Singh, at Lahore, and from whom Mr. Braid
derived his information, makes the following observations:&mdash;“I
share entirely in the apparent incredibility
of the fact of a man being buried alive and surviving
the trial for various periods of duration; but however
incompatible with our knowledge of physiology, in the
absence of any visible proof to the contrary, I am bound
to declare my belief in the facts which I have represented,
however impossible their existence may appear
to others.” Upon this Mr. Braid observes:&mdash;“Such then
is the narrative of Sir C. M. Wade, and when we consider
the high character of the author as a gentleman
of honour, talents, and attainments of the highest order,
and the searching, painstaking efforts displayed by him
throughout the whole investigation, and his close proximity
to the body of the fakir, and opportunity of
observing minutely every point for himself, as well as
the facilities, by his personal intercourse with Runjeet
Singh and the whole of his Court, of gaining the most
accurate information on every point, I conceive it is
impossible to have had a more valuable or conclusive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
document for determining the fact that no collusion or
deception existed.”</p>

<p>A case of this kind was exhibited at the Westminster
Aquarium in the autumn of 1895, which was carefully
watched and tested by medical experts, without detection
of any appearance of fraud or simulation. The
hypnotised man, Walter Johnson, an ex-soldier, twenty-nine
years of age, was in a trance which lasted thirty
days, during which time he was absolutely unconscious,
as shown by the various experiments to which he was
subjected.</p>

<p>A case of induced trance and experimental burial, not
unlike that of the Indian fakirs referred to, was reported
in the London <i>Daily Chronicle</i>, March 14, 1896. The
experiment was carried out under test conditions.</p>


<div class="pbq">

<p class="pc1">“‘BURIED ALIVE’ AT THE ROYAL AQUARIUM.</p>

<p>“After being entombed for six days in a hypnotic trance, Alfred
Wootton was dug up and awakened at the Royal Aquarium
(Westminster), on Saturday night in the presence of a crowd of
interested spectators. Wootton was hypnotised on Monday by
Professor Fricker, and consigned to his voluntary grave, nine feet
deep, in view of the audience, who sealed the stout casket or coffin
in which the subject was immured. Seven or eight feet of earth
were then shovelled upon the body, a shaft being left open for the
necessary respiration, and in order that the public might be
able to see the man’s face during the week. The experiment
was a novel one in this country, and was intended to illustrate
the extraordinary effect produced by the Indian fakirs, and to
demonstrate the connection between hypnotism and psychology,
while also showing the value of the former art as a curative agent.
Wootton is a man thirty-eight years of age; he is a lead-worker,
and on Monday weighed 10st. 2-1/2 lbs. He had previously been in a
trance for a week in Glasgow, under Professor Fricker’s experienced
hands, so was not altogether new to the business; but he is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
the first to be ‘buried alive’ by way of amusement. To the uninitiated
the whole thing was gruesome in the extreme, and this
particular form of entertainment certainly cannot be commended.
Before being covered in, Wootton’s nose and ears were stopped
with wax, which was removed before he was revived on Saturday.
The theory of the burial is to secure an equable temperature day
and night&mdash;which is impossible when the subject is above ground
in the ordinary way&mdash;and therefore to induce a deeper trance. Of
course, too, the patient was out of reach of the operator, and no
suspicion of continuous hypnotising could rest upon the professor.
No nourishment could be supplied for the same reason, though
the man’s lips were occasionally moistened by means of a damp
sponge on the end of a rod, and no record of temperature or
respiration could be kept. A good many people witnessed the
digging up process, and the awakening took place in the concert
room, whither the casket and its burden were conveyed. The
professor was not long in arousing his subject, after electric and
other tests had been applied to convince the audience that the
man was perfectly insensible to pain and everything else. Indeed,
a large needle was run through the flesh on the back of the hand
without any effect whatever. The first thing on regaining consciousness
that Wootton said was that he could not see, and then
he asked for drink&mdash;milk, and subsequently a little brandy, being
supplied. As soon as possible the patient was lifted out of his box,
and with help was quickly able to walk about the platform. He
complained of considerable stiffness of the limbs, and was undoubtedly
weak, but otherwise seemed none the worse for his
remarkable retirement from active life, and abstention from food
for nearly a week. He was swathed in flannel, and soon found the
heat of the room very oppressive, though at first he appeared to
be particularly anxious to have his overcoat and his boots. It
is anticipated that in a day or two at most Wootton will have
regained his usual vigorous health.”</p></div>

<div class="sidenote">EXPERIMENTAL BURIAL.</div>

<p class="p1">Dr. Hartmann in “Premature Burial,” page 23, relates
an account of a similar experiment with a fakir,
differing from the above, however, in so far as it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
made by some English residents, who did not put the
coffin into the earth, but hung it up in the air, so as to
protect it from the danger of being eaten up by white
ants. There seems to be hardly any limitation in regard
to the time during which such a body may be preserved
and become reanimated again, provided that it is well
protected, although modern ignorance may smile at this
statement.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> the sitting of the Paris Academy of Medicine,
on April 10, 1827, a paper was read by M. Chantourelle,
on the danger of hasty burial. This led to a discussion,
in which M. Desgenettes stated that he had been told
by Dr. Thouret, who presided at the destruction of
the vaults of Les Innocens, that many skeletons had
been found in positions seeming to show that they had
turned in their coffins. Dr. Thouret was so much impressed

and ordered everything for her decent interment.
Accordingly, on the third day after her supposed
decease, she was buried in Holy Ghost Chapel, at the
outside of the town, in a vault belonging to the family,
over which there is a school for poor children endowed
by a charitable gentleman in the reign of Edward VI.
It happened the next day that the boys, while they
were at play, heard a noise in the vault, and one of
them ran and told his master, who, not crediting what
he said, gave him a box on the ear and sent him about
his business; but, upon the other boys coming with the
same story, his curiosity was awakened, so that he sent
immediately for the sexton, and opened the vault and
the lady’s coffin, where they found her just expiring.
All possible means were used to recover her to life, but
to no purpose, for she, in her agony, had bit the nails
off her fingers, and tore her face and head to that
degree, that, notwithstanding all the care that was
taken of her, she died in a few hours in inexpressible
torment.”</p>

<p>The <i>Sunday Times</i>, London, December 30, 1838,
contains the following:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“A frightful case of premature interment occurred not long
since, at Tonneins, in the Lower Garonne. The victim, a man
in the prime of life, had only a few shovelfuls of earth thrown into
his grave, when an indistinct noise was heard to proceed from his
coffin. The grave-digger, terrified beyond description, instantly
fled to seek assistance, and some time elapsed before his return,
when the crowd, which had by this time collected in considerable
numbers round the grave, insisted on the coffin being opened. As
soon as the first boards had been removed, it was ascertained,
beyond a doubt, that the occupant had been interred alive. His
countenance was frightfully contracted with the agony he had
undergone; and, in his struggles, the unhappy man had forced his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
arms completely out of the winding sheet, in which they had been
securely enveloped. A physician, who was on the spot, opened a
vein, but no blood followed. The sufferer was beyond the reach
of art.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">RESUSCITATION IN GREENWOOD CEMETERY.</div>

<p class="p1">Mr. Oscar F. Shaw, Attorney-at-Law, 145 Broadway,
New York, furnished the author with particulars of the
following case, of which he had personal knowledge:&mdash;“In
or about the year 1851, Virginia M’Donald, who,
up to that time had lived with her father on Catharine
Street, in the City of New York, apparently died, and
was buried in Greenwood Cemetery, Brooklyn, N.Y.</p>

<p>“After the burial her mother declared her belief that
the daughter was not dead when buried, and persistently
asserted her belief. The family tried in various
ways to assure the mother of the death of her daughter,
and even resorted to ridicule for that purpose; but the
mother insisted so long and so strenuously that her
daughter was buried alive, that finally the family consented
to having the body taken up, when to their
horror, they discovered the body lying on the side, the
hands badly bitten, and every indication of a premature
burial.”</p>

<p>The <i>Lancet</i>, May 22, 1858, p. 519, has the following:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="pc1">“INTERMENT BEFORE DEATH.</p>

<p>“A case of restoration to consciousness after burial is recorded
by the Austrian journals in the person of a rich manufacturer,
named Oppelt, at Rudenberg. He was buried fifteen years ago,
and lately, on opening the vault, the lid of the coffin was found
forced open, and his skeleton in a sitting posture in a corner
of the vault. A Government Commission has reported on the
matter.”</p></div>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="pc1">“PREMATURE INTERMENT.</p>

<p>“Amongst the papers left by the great Meyerbeer, were some
which showed that he had a profound dread of premature interment.
He directed, it is stated, that his body should be left for
ten days undisturbed, with the face uncovered, and watched night
and day. Bells were to be fastened to his feet. And at the end
of the second day veins were to be opened in the arm and leg.
This is the gossip of the capital in which he died. The first
impression is that such a fear is morbid. No doubt fewer precautions
would suffice, but now and again cases occur which seem
to warrant such a feeling, and to show that want of caution may
lead to premature interment in cases unknown. An instance is
mentioned by the <i>Ost. Deutscher Post</i> of Vienna. A few days
since, runs the story, in the establishment of the Brothers of
Charity in that capital, the bell of the dead-room was heard to
ring violently, and on one of the attendants proceeding to the
place to ascertain the cause, he was surprised at seeing one of the
supposed dead men pulling the bell-rope. He was removed immediately
to another room, and hopes are entertained of his recovery.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">From the <i>Times</i>, July 7, 1867, p. 12, col. 3.</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“The <i>Journal de Pontarlier</i> relates a case of premature interment.
During the funeral, three days back, of a young woman at
Montflorin, who had apparently died in an epileptic fit, the grave-digger,
after having thrown a spadeful of earth on the coffin,
thought he heard a moaning from the tomb. The body was
consequently exhumed, and a vein having been opened, yielded
blood almost warm and liquid. Hopes were for a moment entertained
that the young woman would recover from her lethargy,
but she never did so entirely, and the next day life was found to
be extinct.”</p>

<p class="pc1">“PREMATURE INTERMENT.</p>

<p>“The <i>Messager du Midi</i> relates the following dreadful story:&mdash;A
young married woman residing at Salon (Bouches du Rhône)
died shortly after her confinement in August last. The medical
man, who was hastily summoned when her illness assumed a
dangerous form, certified her death, and recommended immediate
burial in consequence of the intense heat then prevailing, and
six hours afterwards the body was interred. A few days since,
the husband having resolved to re-marry, the mother of his late
wife desired to have her daughter’s remains removed to her native
town, Marseilles. When the vault was opened a horrible sight
presented itself. The corpse lay in the middle of the vault, with
dishevelled hair and the linen torn to pieces. It evidently had
been gnawed in her agony by the unfortunate victim. The shock
which the dreadful spectacle caused to the mother has been so
great that fears are entertained for her reason, if not for her life.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">The <i>British Medical Journal</i>, December 8, 1877,
p. 819, inserts the following:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="pc1">“BURIED ALIVE.</p>

<p>“A correspondent at Naples states that the Appeal Court has
had before it a case not likely to inspire confidence in the minds
of those who look forward with horror to the possibility of being
buried alive. It appeared from the evidence that some time ago
a woman was interred with all the usual formalities, it being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
believed that she was dead, while she was only in a trance.
Some days afterwards, the grave in which she had been placed
being opened for the reception of another body, it was found that
the clothes which covered the unfortunate woman were torn to
pieces, and that she had even broken her limbs in attempting to
extricate herself from the living tomb. The Court, after hearing
the case, sentenced the doctor who had signed the certificate of
decease, and the mayor who had authorised the interment, each
to three months’ imprisonment for involuntary manslaughter.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">From the <i>Daily Telegraph</i>, January 18, 1889.</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“A gendarme was buried alive the other day in a village near
Grenoble. The man had become intoxicated on potato brandy,
and fell into a profound sleep. After twenty hours passed in
slumber, his friends considered him to be dead, particularly as
his body assumed the usual rigidity of a corpse. When the
sexton, however, was lowering the remains of the ill-fated gendarme
into the grave, he heard moans and knocks proceeding
from the interior of the ‘four-boards.’ He immediately bored
holes in the sides of the coffin, to let in air, and then knocked off
the lid. The gendarme had, however, ceased to live, having
horribly mutilated his head in his frantic but futile efforts to burst
his coffin open.”</p>

<p class="p1">The <i>Undertakers’ and Funeral Directors’ Journal</i>, July
22, 1889, relates the following cases:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“A New York undertaker recently told the following story, the
circumstances of which are still remembered by old residents of
the city:&mdash;‘About forty years ago a lady living on Division Street,
New York City, fell dead, apparently, while in the act of dancing
at a ball.<span class="sidenote1">EVIDENCE OF UNDERTAKERS.</span> It was a fashionable affair, and being able to afford it,
she wore costly jewellery. Her husband, a flour merchant, who
loved her devotedly, resolved that she should be interred in her
ball dress, diamonds, pearls, and all; also that there should be no
autopsy. As the weather was very inclement when the funeral
reached the cemetery, the body was placed in the receiving vault<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
for burial next day. The undertaker was not a poor man, but he
was avaricious, and he made up his mind to possess the jewellery.
He went in the night, and took the lady’s watch from the folds of
her dress. He next began to draw a diamond ring from her finger,
and in doing so had to use violence enough to tear the skin. Then
the lady moved and groaned, and the thief, terrified and conscience-stricken,
fled from the cemetery, and has never been since heard
from, that I know of. The lady, after the first emotions of horror
at her unheard-of position had passed over, gathered her nerves
together and stepped out of the vault, which the thief had left
open. How she came home I cannot tell; but this I know&mdash;she
lived and had children, two at least of whom are alive to-day.’</p>

<div class="sidenote1">HORRIFYING CASES.</div>

<p>“Another New York undertaker told this story. The New
York papers thirty-five years ago were full of its ghastly details.
‘The daughter of a Court Street baker died. It was in winter,
and the father, knowing that a married sister of his dead child,
who lived in St. Louis, would like to see her face before laid in
the grave for ever, had the body placed in the vault, waiting her
arrival. The sister came, the vault was opened, the lid of the
coffin taken off, when, to the unutterable horror of the friends
assembled, they found the grave-clothes torn in shreds, and the
fingers of both hands eaten off. The girl had been buried alive.’</p>

<p>“Until about forty years ago a noted family of Virginia preserved
a curious custom, which had been religiously observed for
more than a century. Over a hundred years ago a member of the
family died, and, upon being exhumed, was found to have been
buried alive. From that time until about 1850, every member of
the family, man, woman, or child, who died, was stabbed in the
heart with a knife in the hands of the head of the house. The
reason for the cessation of this custom was that in 1850 or thereabouts
a beautiful young girl was supposed to be dead, the knife
was plunged into her bosom, when she gave vent to a fearful
scream and died. She had merely been in a trance. The incident
broke her father’s heart, and in a fit of remorse he killed himself
not long afterwards.</p>

<p>“There are many families in the United States who, when any
of their number dies, insist that an artery be opened to determine
whether life has fled or not.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">The following remarkable case of waking in the grave
is reported from Vienna:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“A lady residing at Derbisch, near Kolin, in Bohemia, where
she owned considerable property, was buried last week, after a
brief illness, in the family vault at the local cemetery. Four days
afterwards her granddaughter was interred in the same place, but
as the stone slab covering the aperture was removed, the bystanders
were horrified to see that the lid of the coffin below had
been raised, and that the arm of the corpse was protruding. It
was ascertained eventually that the unfortunate lady, who was
supposed to have died of heart disease, had been buried alive.
She had evidently recovered consciousness for a few minutes, and
had found strength enough to burst open her coffin. The authorities
are bent on taking measures of the utmost severity against
those responsible.”&mdash;<i>Undertakers’ Journal, August 22, 1889.</i></p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“A horrible story comes from Majola, Mantua. The body of
a woman, named Lavrinia Merli, a peasant, who was supposed to
have died from hysterics, was placed in a vault on Thursday,
July 3. On Saturday evening it was found that the woman had
regained consciousness, torn her grave-clothes in her struggles,
had turned completely over in the coffin, and had given birth to a
seven-months’-old child. Both mother and child were dead when
the coffin was opened for the last time previous to interment.”</p>

<p>“A shocking occurrence is reported from Cesa, a little village
near Naples. A woman living at that place was recently seized
with sudden illness. A doctor who was called certified that the
woman was dead, and the body was consequently placed in a
coffin, which was deposited in the watch-house of the local
cemetery. Next day an old woman passing close to the cemetery
thought she heard smothered cries proceeding from the watch-house.
The family was informed, but when the lid of the coffin
was forced off a shocking spectacle presented itself to the gaze of
the horrified villagers. The wretched woman had turned on her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
side, and the position of her arm showed that she had made
a desperate effort to raise the lid. The eldest son, who was
among the persons who broke open the coffin, received such
a shock that he died three days later.”&mdash;<i>Undertakers’ Journal,

<p class="p1">The <i>Progressive Thinker</i>, of November 14, 1891, relates
that:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Farmer George Hefdecker, who lived at Erie, Pa., died very
suddenly two weeks ago, of what is supposed to have been heart
failure. The body was buried temporarily four days later in a
neighbour’s lot in the Erie cemetery pending the purchase of one
by his family. The transfer was made in a few days, and when
the casket was opened at the request of his family, a horrifying
spectacle was presented. The body had turned round, and the
face and interior of the casket bore the traces of a terrible struggle
with death in its most awful shape. The distorted and blood-covered
features bore evidence of the agony endured. The clothing
about the head and neck had been torn into shreds, as was
likewise the lining of the coffin. Bloody marks of finger nails
on the face, throat, and neck, told of the awful despair of the
doomed man, who tore his own flesh in his terrible anguish.
Several fingers had been entirely bitten off, and the hands torn
with the teeth until they scarcely resembled those of a human
being.”</p></blockquote>

<p>“A story of a horrible nature comes from St. Petersburg in
connection with the interment at Tioobayn, near that city, of a
peasant girl named Antonova. She had presumably died, and in
due course the funeral took place. After the service at the
cemetery, the grave-diggers were startled by sounds of moaning
proceeding from the coffin. Instead, however, of instantly breaking
it open, they rushed off to find a doctor, and when he and some
officials arrived and broke open the shell, the unhappy inmate was
already the corpse she had been supposed to be a day earlier. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
was evident, however, that no efforts could have saved life at the
last moment. The body was half-turned in the coffin, the left
hand, having escaped its bandages, being under the cheek.”</p></div>

<p class="pc1">“SOUNDS FROM ANOTHER COFFIN.</p>

<p class="pr2">“Grenoble, August 17.</p>

<p>“On Monday last a man was found in a dying condition by the
side of a brook near the village of Le Pin. Everything possible
was done for him, but he relapsed into unconsciousness, and
became to all appearances dead. The funeral was arranged, and,
there being no suspicion of foul play, the body was interred on
the following day. The coffin had been lowered to the bottom of
the grave, and the sexton had begun to cover it with earth, when
he heard muffled sounds proceeding from it. The earth was
hastily removed and the coffin opened, when it was discovered
that the unfortunate occupant was alive. He was taken to a
neighbouring house, but rapidly sank into a comatose condition,
and died without uttering a word. The second burial took place
yesterday.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">While in India, in the early part of this year (1896),
Dr. Roger S. Chew, of Calcutta, who, having been laid
out for dead, and narrowly escaped living sepulture, has
had the best reasons for studying the subject, gave me
particulars of the following cases:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“Frank Lascelles, aged thirty-two years, was seated at breakfast
with a number of us young fellows, and was in the middle of a
burst of hearty laughter, when his head fell forward on his plate
and he was ‘dead.’ As there was a distinct history of cardiac disease
in his family, while he himself had frequently been treated for
valvular disease of the heart, he was alleged to have ‘died’ of cardiac
failure, and was duly interred in the Coonor Cemetery. Some
six months later, permission was obtained to remove his remains
to St. John’s Church-yard in Ootacamund. The coffin was exhumed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
and, as a ‘matter of form,’ the lid removed to identify the
resident, when, to the horror of the lookers-on, it was noticed that,
though mummification had taken place, there had been a fearful
struggle underground, for the body, instead of being on its back as
it was when first coffined, was <i>lying on its face</i>, with its arms and
legs drawn up as close as the confined space would permit. His
trousers (a perfectly new pair) were burst at the left knee, while
his shirt-front was torn to ribands and bloodstained, and the
wood of that portion of the coffin immediately below his mouth
was stained a deep reddish-brown-black (<i>blood</i>). Old Dr.
Donaldson, whom we were all very fond of, tried to explain
matters by saying that the jolting of the coffin on its way to the
cemetery had overturned the body, and that the blood stains on
the shirt and wood were the natural result of blood flowing (<i>i.e.</i>
oozing) out of the mouth of the corpse as it lay face downwards.
A nice theory, but scarcely a probable one, as all the jolting in
creation could not possibly turn a corpse over in an Indian coffin,
which is so built that there is scarcely two inches spare space over
any portion of the contained body, and unless the supposed corpse
regained consciousness and exerted <i>considerable</i> force, it could not
possibly turn round in its <i>narrow</i> casket.</p>

<p>“Mary Norah Best, aged seventeen years, an adopted daughter
of Mrs. C. A. Moore, <i>née</i> Chew,<span class="sidenote1">DR. ROGER S. CHEW’S CASES.</span> ‘died’ of cholera, and was entombed
in the Chew’s vault in the old French cemetery, at Calcutta.
The certifying surgeon was a man who would have benefited by
her death, and had twice (though ineffectually) attempted to put an
end to her adopted mother, who fled from India to England after
the second attempt on her life, but, unfortunately, left the girl
behind. When Mary ‘died’ she was put into a <i>pine</i> coffin, the
lid of which was <i>nailed</i>, not screwed, down. In 1881, ten years
or so later, the vault was unsealed to admit the body of Mrs.
Moore’s brother, J. A. A. Chew. On entering the vault, the undertaker’s
assistant and I found the lid of Mary’s coffin on the floor,
while the position of the skeleton (half in, half out of the coffin,
and an ugly gash across the right parietal bone) <i>plainly</i> showed
that after being entombed Mary awoke from her trance, struggled
violently till she wrenched the lid off her coffin, when she either
fainted away with the strain of the effort in bursting open her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
casket, and while falling forward over the edge of her coffin struck
her head against the masonry shelf, and died almost immediately;
or, worse still,&mdash;as surmised by some of her clothing which was
found hanging over the edge of the coffin, and the position of her
right hand, the fingers of which were bent and close to where
her throat would have been had the flesh not rotted away,&mdash;she
recovered consciousness, fought for life, forced her coffin open, and,
sitting up in the pitchy darkness of the vault, went mad with
fright, tore her clothes off, tried to throttle herself, and banged her
head against the masonry shelf until she fell forward senseless
and dead.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">Dr. Chew says:&mdash;“Though a layman, still it would be
hard to find a more indefatigable sanitarian than my
late commanding officer, Lieutenant-Colonel R. C.
Sterndale, of the Presidency Volunteer Rifle Battalion,
and for many years vice-chairman of the municipality of
the suburbs of Calcutta. In order to prove his theory
that a great deal of danger existed in the rainy season
from subsoil water rising up into the graves, saturating
the bodies, and then poisoning the neighbouring tanks
and wells, he caused a trench, ten feet long, six deep,
and four wide, to be dug across an old Mahomedan
grave-yard. Soundings and measurements having been
taken of the subsoil water, he had a tarpaulin stretched
over the trench, and daily measured the ‘fall’ of the
water-level. He had a drawing made of the section of
that grave-yard in which the action of the nitre-laden
water seemed to mummify some of the bodies. Amongst
the rest was a somewhat mummified male corpse which,
instead of being on his back, was lying on his abdomen;
the left arm supported the chin, but had a piece of it
missing; the right hand clutched the left elbow, and the
general position of the body was as if, consciousness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
having returned, the alleged corpse sat up, found the
weight of the earth too heavy to work through, and then,
dying of suffocation, fell forward in the position in which
it was found and exposed.”</p>

<p>Dr. Chew adds:&mdash;“I have heard and read of several
other instances, but, as they have not come within my
personal observation, I do not mention or refer to
them.”</p>

<p class="pch">NARROW ESCAPES FROM PREMATURE BURIAL.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Almost</span> every intelligent and observant person you
converse with, if the subject is introduced, has either
known or heard of narrow escapes of premature burial
within his or her own circle of friends or acquaintances;
and it is no exaggeration to say that such cases are
numbered by thousands. It is to be hoped that the
number of timely discoveries vastly exceed those actually
interred in a state of suspended animation; but as no
investigation of grave-yards or cemeteries (which effectually
conceal their own tragedies) has ever taken place in
England until the remains are reduced to dust, and
rarely in other countries, one cannot be sure that this
optimistic view is correct. The following cases of narrow
escape appear to rest upon trustworthy evidence.</p>

<p>An apparent suspension of life, following a serious
illness, is usually considered a satisfactory proof of the
reality of the expected death; but these conditions
cannot always be relied upon. Cases are on record
where the objects of such simulacra of death appear, if
let alone, to gather the essence of renewed vitality, and
return to consciousness. The <i>Undertakers’ and Funeral
Directors’ Journal</i> of May, 1888, has a case in point.</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Mrs. Lockhart, of Birkhill, who died in 1825, used to relate to
her grandchildren the following anecdote of her ancestor, Sir
William Lindsay, of Covington, towards the close of the seventeenth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
century:&mdash;‘Sir William was a humorist,<span class="sidenote1">A RESUSCITATED HUMORIST.</span> and noted, moreover,
for preserving the picturesque appendage of a beard at
a period when the fashion had long passed away. He had been
extremely ill, and life was at last supposed to be extinct, though,
as it afterwards turned out, he was merely in a “dead faint” or
trance. The female relatives were assembled for the “chesting”&mdash;the
act of putting a corpse into a coffin, with the entertainment
given on such melancholy occasions&mdash;in a lighted chamber in the
old tower of Covington, where the “bearded knight” lay stretched
upon his bier. But when the servants were about to enter to
assist at the ceremonies, Isabella Somerville, Sir William’s great-granddaughter,
and Mrs. Lockhart’s grandmother, then a child,
creeping close to her mother, whispered into her ear, “The beard
is wagging! the beard is wagging!” Mrs. Somerville, upon this,
looked to the bier, and observing indications of life in the ancient
knight, made the company retire, and Sir William soon came out
of his faint. Hot bottles were applied and cordials administered,
and in the course of the evening he was able to converse with his
family. They explained that they had believed him to be actually
dead, and that arrangements had even been made for his funeral.
In answer to the question, “Have the folks been warned?” (<i>i.e.</i>,

day had been fixed, an ox slain, and other preparations made for
entertaining the company. Sir William then said, “All is as it
should be; keep it a dead secret that I am in life, and let the
folks come.” His wishes were complied with, and the company
assembled for the burial at the appointed time. After some delay,
occasioned by the non-arrival of the clergyman, as was supposed,
and which afforded an opportunity of discussing the merits of the
deceased, the door suddenly opened, when, to their surprise and
terror, in stepped the knight himself, pale in countenance and
dressed in black, leaning on the arm of the minister of the parish
of Covington. Having quieted their alarm and explained matters,
he called upon the clergyman to conduct an act of devotion, which
included thanksgiving for his recovery and escape from being
buried alive. This done, the dinner succeeded. A jolly evening,
after the manner of the time, was passed, Sir William himself
presiding over the carousals.’”</p>

<p class="p1">Dr. J. B. Vigné, in his “Memoire sur les Inhumations
Précipitées,” Paris, 1839, narrates the following:&mdash;
“Mr. B., an inhabitant of Poitiers, fell suddenly into a
state resembling death; every means for bringing him
back to life were used without interruption; from continued
dragging, his two little fingers were dislocated,
and the soles of his feet were burnt; but, all these having
produced no sensation in him, he was thought decidedly
dead. As they were on the point of placing him in his
coffin, some one recommended that he should be bled
in both arms and feet at the same time, which was
immediately done, and with such success that, to the
astonishment of all, he recovered from his apparent
state of death. When he had entirely recovered his
senses, he declared that he had heard every word that
had been said, and that his only fear was that he would
be buried alive.”</p>

<p class="psh">APPARENT DEATH IN PREGNANCY.</p>

<p>Hufeland (one of the greatest authorities on the subject
in Germany), in his essay upon the uncertainty of the
signs of death, tells of a case of the wife of Professor
Camerer, of Tübingen, who was hysterical, and had a
fright in the sixth month of her pregnancy, which brought
on convulsions (eclampsia), which continued for four
hours, when she seemed to die completely. Two celebrated
physicians, besides three others of less note, regarded
the case as ended in death, as all the recognised
signs of death were present. However, attempts to
revive her were at once resorted to, and were continued
for five hours, when all the medical attendants, except
one, gave the case up, and left. The physician who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
remained pulled off a blister-plaster that had been put
on one of the feet, when the lady gave feeble signs of life
by twitchings about the mouth. The doctor then renewed
his efforts to revive her, by various stimulating
means, and by burning, and by pricking the spine; but
all in vain, for after her slight evidences of revival, she
seemed to die unmistakably. She lay in a state of
apparent death for six days, but there was a small space
over the heart where a little warmth could be detected
by the hand, and on this account the burial was put off.
On the seventh day she opened her eyes, and slowly
revived, but was completely unconscious of all that had
happened. She then gave birth to a dead child, and
soon thereafter recovered her health completely.</p>

<p class="pc1">“THE DEAD ALIVE.</p>

<p>“It seems to be always desirable to obtain a contemporary
record of all unusual phenomena. It is so more
especially where they are of a somewhat indefinite character,
and scarcely susceptible of exaggeration. We
know of none which are more so than the cases of
‘trance.’<span class="sidenote1">MORE CAREFUL EXAMINATION REQUIRED.</span> These examples are both sufficiently unusual
to deserve a passing record, and sufficiently mysterious
in their character to call for a more careful investigation
than it has hitherto been possible to accord to them.
We transcribe the facts of a recent instance, as they are
circumstantially detailed, and, no doubt, some of the
surgeons of Coventry will be able to afford their
testimony as to the degree of correspondence of this
narrative with their observations.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
“The girl, whose name is Amelia Hinks, is twelve or
thirteen years of age, and resides with her parents in
Bridge Street, Nuneaton. She had lately appeared to
be sinking under the influence of some ill-explained
disorder, and about three weeks since, as her friends
imagined, she died. The body was removed to another
room. It was rigid and icy cold. It was washed and
laid out with all due funeral train. The limbs were
decently placed, the eyelids closed and penny-pieces
laid over them. The coffin was ordered. For more
than forty-eight hours the supposed corpse lay beneath
the winding-sheet, when it happened that her grandfather,
coming from Leamington to assist in the last
mournful ceremonies, went to see the corpse. The old
man removed a penny-piece, and he thought that the
corpse winked! There was a convulsive movement of
the lid. This greatly disturbed his composure; for,
though he had heard that she died with her eyes open,
he was unprepared for this palpebral signal of her good
understanding with death. A surgeon is said to have
been summoned, who at first treated the matter as a
delusion, but subsequently ascertained stethoscopically
that there was still slight cardiac pulsation. The body
was then removed to a warm room, and gradually the
returning signs of animation became unequivocal. When
speech was restored, the girl described many things
which had taken place since her supposed death. She
knew who had closed her eyes and placed the coppers
thereon. She also heard the order given for her coffin,
and could repeat the various remarks made over her as
she lay in her death-clothes. She refused food, though
in a state of extreme debility. She has since shown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
symptoms of mania, and is now said to have relapsed into
a semi-cataleptic condition. The parents are ‘creditable
people,’ and there is no apparent ruse in this unusually
romantic history, which is causing considerable excitement
in Nuneaton and its neighbourhood.”</p></div>

<p class="pc1">“‘THE DEAD ALIVE.’<br />
“(To the Editor of the <i>Lancet</i>.)</p>

<p>“Sir,&mdash;An article, ‘The Dead Alive,’ in your impression of the
27th ultimo, demands of me a veritable statement of the case
alluded to. The subject of the inquiry is still living, and for some
time past has afforded me scope for observation.</p>

<div class="sidenote1">THE DEAD ALIVE.</div>

<p>“I have only been waiting for a termination of the case, either
in convalescence or death, to enable me to give to the profession,
through your valuable columns, a full and truthful history of this
rare and curious case, replete with interest. The exaggerated
statement which has gone the round of the press has produced
such great curiosity in this immediate neighbourhood that I have
been applied to by many parties, professional and non-professional,
to be permitted to see the case, the parents of the patient
having refused admittance to all strangers.</p>

<p>“The case having extended over a long period, and fearing
a detailed account might occupy too much of your valuable space,
I have condensed the matter as much as possible; but should the
profession consider the case worthy of a more enlarged history,
I will gladly, at some future period, meet their wishes, as far as
my rough notes, aided by my memory, will supply it.</p>

<p>“In August, 1858, I was requested to visit Miss Amelia Hincks,
aged twelve years and nine months, daughter of a harness-maker,
and residing with her parents in Bridge Street, Nuneaton. She
was supposed to be suffering from pulmonary consumption....
On October 18, about half-past three a.m., she apparently died.
She is said to have groaned heavily, waved her hands (which was
a promised sign for her mother to know that the hour of her
departure was come), turned her head a little to the light, dropped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
her jaw, and <i>died</i>. In about half an hour after her supposed
departure she was washed, and attired in clean linen, the jaw was
tied by a white handkerchief, penny-pieces laid over her eyes,
her hands, semi-clenched, placed by her side, and her feet tied
together by a piece of tape. She was then carried into another
room, laid on a sofa, and covered over with a sheet. She appeared
stiff and cold, two large books were placed on her feet, and I
have no doubt she was considered to be a sweet corpse.</p>

<p>“About nine a.m., the grandfather of the supposed dead went
into the death-chamber to give a last kiss to his grandchild, when
he fancied he saw a convulsive movement of the eyelid, he having
raised one of the coins. He communicated this fact to the parents
and mourning friends, but they ridiculed the old man’s statement,
and said the movement of the eyelids was owing to the nerves
working after death. Their theory, however, did not satisfy the
experienced man of eighty years, and he could not reconcile himself
to her death. As soon as I reached home, after having been
out in the country all night, I was requested to see the child, to
satisfy the old man that she was really dead. About half-past ten
a.m. I called; and immediately on my entrance into the chamber
I perceived a tremulous condition of the eyelids, such as we
frequently see in hysterical patients. The penny-pieces had been
removed by the grandfather. I placed a stethoscope over the
region of the heart, and found that organ performing its functions
perfectly and with tolerable force. I then felt for a radial pulse,
which was easily detected, beating feebly, about seventy-five per
minute. The legs and arms were stiff and cold, and the capillary
circulation was so congested as at first sight to resemble incipient
decomposition. I carefully watched the chest, which heaved
quietly but almost imperceptibly; and immediately unbandaged
the maiden, and informed her mourning parents that she was not
dead. Imagine their consternation! The passing-bell had rung,
the shutters were closed, the undertaker was on his way to measure
her for her coffin, and other necessary preparations were being
made for her interment. [The writer then proceeds to give interesting
details as to the treatment of the case, and the means
taken to promote recovery.]</p>

<p class="psh">THE QUESTION OF PREMATURE BURIAL BEFORE THE
FRENCH SENATE.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FRENCH CASES.</div>

<p>The <i>Medical Times</i>, London, 1866, vol. i., p. 258, under
the heading “Buried Alive” remarks as follows:&mdash;“The
abundance of other topics hinders us at present from
saying more than a few words on the conditions
under which there may be real danger of burial before
life is quite extinct. Now, we will only reproduce the
cases reported by Cardinal Archbishop Donnet, in the
French Senate, in a discussion on a petition that the
time between death and burial should be lengthened.
We will add one instance, which we have heard on the
best authority:&mdash;About thirty years ago, a young
woman of eighteen, daughter of Madame Laligand,
living in the Rue des Tonnelliers, at Beaune, in Burgundy,
was supposed to have died. The ordinary
measures were taken for interment. The body was put
in a coffin, and taken to the church; the funeral service
was said, and the <i>cortége</i> set out for the cemetery; but
on the road between the church and the cemetery the
supposed dead recovered power of motion and speech,
was removed from the coffin, put to bed, recovered,
married, and lived eighteen years afterwards. She said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
she retained her consciousness during the whole of her
supposed death, and had counted the nails that were
driven into her coffin. Statements such as these, and
such as those made by the Archbishop, will surely be
subjected to the ordeal of a French scientific commission,
and we may suspend our judgment for the present.
To return to his Eminence. He said he had the very
best reasons for believing that the victims of hasty
interments were more numerous than people supposed.
He considered the rules and regulations prescribed by
the law very judicious; but, unfortunately, they were,
particularly in the country, not always executed as they
should be, nor was sufficient importance attached to
them. In the village he was stationed in as an assistant-curate
in the first period of his sacerdotal life, he saved
two persons from being buried alive. The first an
aged man, who lived twelve hours after the hour prescribed
for his interment by the municipal officer; the
second was a man who was quite restored to life. In
both cases a trance more prolonged than usual was taken
for actual death. The other instances, says the <i>Times’</i>
correspondent, I give in the words of the Archbishop:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“‘The next case that occurred to me was at Bordeaux. A
young lady, who bore one of the most distinguished names in
the Department, had passed through what was supposed the last
agony, and, as apparently all was over, the father and mother
were torn away from the heartrending spectacle. As God willed
it, I happened to pass the door of the house at the moment,
when it occurred to me to call and inquire how the young lady
was going on. When I entered the room, the nurse, finding the
body breathless, was in the act of covering the face, and, indeed,
there was every appearance that life had departed. Somehow or
other, it did not seem to me so certain as to the bystanders. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
lady not to give up all hope&mdash;that I was come to cure her, and
that I was about to pray by her side. “You do not see me,” I
said, “but you hear what I am saying.” My presentiments were
not unfounded. The word of hope I uttered reached her ear and
effected a marvellous change, or, rather, called back the life that
was departing. The young girl survived; she is now a wife, and
mother of children, and this day is the happiness of two most
respectable families.’</p>

<p class="p1">“The Archbishop mentioned another instance of a
similar revival in a town in Hungary during the cholera
of 1831, which he heard that day from one of his
colleagues of the Senate, as they were mounting the
staircase. But the last related is so interesting, and
made such a sensation, that it deserves to be repeated
in his own words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<div class="sidenote1">CARDINAL DONNET’S EXPERIENCE.</div>

<p class="p1">“‘In the summer of 1826, on a close summer day, in a church
which was exceedingly crowded, a young priest, who was in the act
of preaching, was suddenly seized with giddiness in the pulpit.
The words he was uttering became indistinct; he soon lost the
power of speech, and sank down on the floor. He was taken out
of the church and carried home. All was thought to be over.
Some hours after, the funeral bell was tolled, and the usual preparations
made for the interment. His eyesight was gone: but if he
could see nothing, like the young lady I have alluded to he could
hear, and I need not say that what reached his ears was not
calculated to reassure him. The doctor came, examined him,
and pronounced him dead; and after the usual inquiries as to
his age and the place of his birth, etc., gave permission for
his interment next morning. The venerable bishop, in whose
cathedral the young priest was preaching when he was seized
with the fit, came to his bedside to recite the “De Profundis.”
The body was measured for the coffin. Night came on, and you
will easily feel how inexpressible was the anguish of the living
being in such a situation. At last, amid the voices murmuring
around him, he distinguished that of one whom he had known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
from infancy. That voice produced a marvellous effect and
superhuman effort. Of what followed I need say no more than
that the seemingly dead man stood next day in the same pulpit.
That young priest, gentlemen, is the same man who is now speaking
before you, and who, more than forty years after that event,
implores those in authority, not merely to watch vigilantly over the
careful execution of the legal prescriptions with regard to interments,
but to enact fresh ones in order to prevent the recurrence
of irreparable misfortunes.’”</p></div>

<p class="p1">To this report of the <i>Medical Times</i> it may be added
that the petition of M. de Carnot furnished statistics
showing the frequency of these terrible disasters, and
suggested various preventive measures, including the
establishment of mortuaries, a longer interval between
death and burial, and the application of scientific
methods of restoration where decomposition is not
manifest. The reality of the terrible dangers, as pointed
out by Cardinal Donnet, was confirmed by Senators
Tourangin and Viscount de Baral, in the recital of other
cases of premature interment.</p>

<p>When the subject was revived in the Senate on
January 29, 1869&mdash;on which occasion five petitions were
presented, urging important reforms, and detailing other
cases of premature interment,&mdash;Cardinal Donnet again
took part in the debate, and urged that no burial should
be permitted without the signature of a doctor or officer
of health, as well as the written authorisation of the
Mayor, so that the fact of death might always be verified.
The Cardinal then furnished particulars of another recent
case of premature interment in l’Est, and recalled the
fact that one of their honourable colleagues of the
Senate, M. le Comte de la Rue, had had a narrow
escape from live sepulture.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

of the Interior, but nothing was done to remedy the evil.</p>

<p class="psh">“ON SUSPENDED ANIMATION.</p>

<p>“In the course of the address delivered by Dr. Brewer
to the Guardians of St. George’s at St. James’s Hall,
he adverted to the ‘laying-out’ case at St. Pancras....
Dr. Brewer ... dwelt upon the question
of suspended animation in a passage which really
deserves to be quoted....</p>


<div class="pbq">

<div class="sidenote1">CASE REPORTED BY DR. BREWER.</div>

<p class="p1">“‘I have been more than once under a condition of apparently
suspended respiration, and with circumstances less comfortable
than those related of this babe; and yet, active as is my brain,
and sensitive as is my body, I remember as well as though it were
but yesterday that, on being restored to consciousness, no feeling
of discomfort of any kind attended my experience on either occasion.
It is under the truth to say I have known a score of cases of those
who have been supposed dead being reanimated. It is not many
months ago a friend of mine, a rector of a suburban parish, was
pronounced by his medical attendant to be dead. His bed was
arranged, and the room left in its silence. His daughter had
re-entered and sat at the foot, and the solemn toll of his own
church bell was vibrating through the chamber, when a hand drew
aside the closed curtain, and a voice came from the occupant of
the bed&mdash;“Elizabeth, my dear, what is that bell tolling for?”
The daughter’s response was, perhaps, an unfortunate one: “<i>For
you, papa.</i>” Schwartz, the first eminent Indian missionary, was
roused from his supposed death by hearing his favourite hymn
sung over him previous to the last rites being performed, and his
resuscitation made known by his joining in the verse.’”</p></div>

<p class="p1">Dr. B. W. Richardson quotes a case in the <i>Lancet</i>,

narrowly escaped living burial.</p>

<p class="p1">Dr. Moore Russell Fletcher in his work on “Suspended
Animation,” p. 26, says:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“In June, 1869, a girl in Cleveland, Ohio, was taken ill, and
after a short sickness died, and was laid out for burial; but as
her mother insisted that she was not dead, efforts were made for
some time to restore her to life, but in vain. Her mother, however,
refused to let her be buried; and on the fifth day after that
set for the funeral the slamming of a door aroused her, so that
she recovered. She stated that, during most of the eight days
which she lay there, she was conscious and heard what was said,
although wholly unable to make the least motion.”</p>

<p class="p1">Dr. M. S. Tanner in a letter to the <i>New York Times</i>,
January 18, 1880, mentions two cases where persons
awakened from trance at the moment of sepulture
described in turn what their feelings had been. Said
one:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Have you ever felt the paralysing influence of a horrible
nightmare? If you have had such experience, then you are
prepared to conceive of the mental agonies I endured when
I realised that my friends believed me dead, and were making
preparations for my burial. The hours and days of mental
struggle spent in the vain endeavour to break loose from the
vice-like grasp of this worse than horrible nightmare was a hell
of torment such as no tongue can describe or pen portray.”</p>

<p class="p1">The other instance mentioned by Dr. Tanner is that of
Dr. Johnson of St. Charles, Illinois, who in the hearing of
Dr. Tanner, and in the presence of a large audience in
Harrison’s Hall, Minneapolis, stated that when a young
man he was prostrated with a fever. He swooned away,
apparently dead. His attending physician said he was
dead. His father was faithless and unbelieving, and
refused to bury him. He lay in this condition, apparently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
dead, fourteen days.<span class="sidenote">VERDICT OF FOURTEEN PHYSICIANS.</span> The attending physician
brought other physicians to examine the apparently
lifeless form, and all stated unqualifiedly, “He is dead.”
Some fourteen physicians, among them many eminent
professors, examined the body, and there was no
ambiguity in the expression of their conclusion that
the boy was dead. But the father still turned a deaf
ear to all entreaties to prepare the body for the grave.
Public feeling was at last aroused. The health officer
and other city officers, acting in their official capacity,
and by the advice of physicians, peremptorily demanded
that the body be interred without delay. On the
fourteenth day the father yielded under protest; preparations
were made for the funeral, when the emotions
of the still living subject, who was conscious of all
transpiring around him, were so intense as to be the
means of his deliverance. He awoke from his trance.</p>

<p class="pc1">“IMPORTANT SUGGESTION FROM AN M.D.<br />
“(To the Editor of the <i>Lancet</i>.)</p>

<p>“Sir,&mdash;Without venturing to express an opinion on
the case mentioned by the Rev. D. Williams<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> in the
<i>Lancet</i> of the 24th inst., I would beg to say that I have
no doubt in my own mind but that people are sometimes
‘buried alive.’ An instance has come to my
knowledge where this catastrophe was only avoided
by a mere accident. A lady, about forty-five years of
age, the wife of a clergyman in a northern county, was
taken ill, and after some time, as was supposed, died.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
The funeral was delayed, and so was the closing of
the coffin, in consequence of the absence of a son of the
lady from home. When the boy arrived, the kissing,
wailing, and commotion roused the supposed dead
woman, and brought her to consciousness in her coffin.
This lady would most probably have been buried alive
were it not that the obsequies were delayed on account
of the circumstance mentioned.</p>

<p>“Now, may not cases more or less similar to this
sometimes occur, with the catastrophe of ‘buried
alive’ added to them? But no such case could
happen if it were made compulsory that the interment
of a body should not be allowed to take place until
after decomposition had set in, as attested by a medical
man.</p>

<p class="p1">It is not always safe to conclude that persons
enfeebled by age, or exhausted by long and severe
illness, and pronounced dead by the attendant doctor,
are really so. <i>The Undertakers’ Journal</i>, August 23,
1886, has the following:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“It appears that George O. Daniels, of Clinton, Kentucky, had
been ill for several months, and at length, to all appearance, died.
The body was put in a coffin, where it remained for twenty hours,
awaiting the arrival of relatives to attend the funeral. At midnight
the watchers who surrounded the coffin were startled by a deep
groan emanating from it, and all but one, a German of the name
of Wabbeking, rushed from the room. Wabbeking remained, and
as the groans continued he raised the coffin-lid and saw that
Daniels was alive. Seizing the body he placed it upright. A few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
spasmodic gasps, a shudder, and the corpse spoke. The relatives
returned to find the man sitting in a chair, and conversing with
reasonable strength. Mr. Daniels claims to have been perfectly
conscious of everything which passed around him, but says he was
unable to move a muscle. He heard the sobs of his relatives
when he was pronounced dead by the doctors, and noticed the
preparations for the funeral. He is about eighty years of age.”</p>

following under the head of</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="pc1">“RETURNED TO LIFE TWICE.</p>

<p>“The following details are given by the Cincinnati correspondent
of the <i>New York Herald</i> from Memphis, Tennessee:&mdash;Mrs. Dicie
Webb keeps a grocery store on Beale Street, and is well known to
hundreds. Two years ago John Webb, a son of Mrs. Webb,
married Sarah Kelly, a pretty girl, to whom the mother-in-law
became greatly attached. Before one year of their married life
had passed, Mrs. Webb, jun.,<span class="sidenote1">RETURNED TO LIFE TWICE.</span> was stricken with consumption,
and on several occasions came near dying. About a month ago
the young woman became very anxious to visit her parents in
Henderson County, and she was taken there. At first she appeared
much improved, and hopes were felt that her life might be preserved
through the summer, but two weeks ago last Tuesday a
telegram announced her death, and the husband hurried to her
parents’ home. Three days later he returned with the corpse.
The mother-in-law pleaded so hard for a sight of the dead woman,
that finally, despite the belief that the body was badly decomposed,
it was decided to open the coffin. While looking at the placid face
Mrs. Webb was terrified at beholding the eyelids of the dead
woman slowly opening. The eyes did not have the stony stare of
death, nor the intelligent gleam of life. Mrs. Webb was unable to
utter a sound. She could not move, but stood gazing at the gruesome
sight. Her horror was increased when the supposed corpse
slowly sat upright and, in an almost inaudible voice, said, ‘Oh,
where am I?’ At this the weeping woman screamed. Friends
who rushed into the room were almost paralysed at the sight, and
fled shrieking. But one bolder than the others returned and spoke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
to the woman, who asked to be laid on the bed. Hastily she was
taken from the coffin and cared for. In the course of the day the
resurrected woman fully regained her mental powers. The day
following she related a wonderful story. She said she was
cognisant of all that occurred, and did not lose consciousness
until she was put aboard the train for Memphis. Soon after being
placed in her mother-in-law’s house she came to her senses and
knew all that was passing. While her mother-in-law was looking
at her she made a supreme effort to speak. Mrs. Webb lived a
number of days, when she again apparently died. The doctors
pronounced her dead, and she was once more placed in the coffin.
While the mother-in-law was taking her final farewell she heard a
voice whisper, ‘Mother, don’t cry.’ Looking into the girl’s face,
she saw the same look that she had noticed before. She called for
help, and several women responded. Some one cried, ‘Shake
her; she’s not dead.’ In the excitement of the moment, the
women, it is thought, shook the life out of the poor consumptive,
and last Saturday she was buried. The family and friends have
endeavoured to keep the matter quiet.”</p></div>

<p class="pc1">“A NARROW ESCAPE.</p>

<p>“A Rochester correspondent telegraphs that a woman named
Girvin, living at Burham, near Rochester, has just had a narrow
escape of being buried alive. She fell into a kind of trance, which
was mistaken for death. The coffin was ordered, and the usual
preparations made for a funeral. But while a number of the
relatives were gathered at the bedside bewailing their bereavement,
the supposed corpse startled them by suddenly rising up in
bed and asking what was the matter. The woman is making
good progress towards convalescence.”</p></div>

<div class="sidenote1">A CASE AT ST. LEONARDS.</div>

<p class="p1">“Our St. Leonards correspondent telegraphs:&mdash;About a week
ago the wife of a well-known tradesman in St. Leonards fell ill,
and on Monday night last the doctor gave his opinion that she
could not live through the next day. On Tuesday morning at ten
o’clock the doctor pronounced his patient dead, the nurse who was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
in attendance confirming the opinion. The intimation of death
naturally created great distress among the friends of the woman,
who was laid out in grave-clothes, washed, and prepared for burial,
and, being a Roman Catholic, a crucifix was placed in her hand as
she lay on her bier. When it was announced that the woman was
dying, a priest was sent for; but he could not attend, as he was out
of the town at the time.</p>

<p>“About a quarter to ten on Tuesday night the nurse entered the
room without a light for the purpose of getting something which
she knew where to find. Whilst in the darkened chamber she was
startled to hear a slight cry proceeding from the bed where the
body lay, and she rushed from the room in a terrible fright. The
widower, hearing the scream of fright, rushed into the chamber
with a light, and was astounded to find that his wife had raised
herself up in the bed on her elbow. She faintly uttered the words,
‘Where am I?’ and again relapsed into a heavy sleep. The
opportunity was seized of changing the shroud for proper habiliments,
and in about an hour and a half she woke again perfectly
conscious. Next morning she was told of what had occurred, but
was quite ignorant of everything that had passed, thinking she had
only had a long sleep. She is now doing well, and it is hoped she
will soon be restored to health and strength. The doctor describes
the case as the most remarkable he has ever met with in his
experience.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">Dr. Frederick A. Floyer, of Mortimer, Berks, published
the following-case in the <i>Tocsin</i>, November 1, 1889,
vol. i., p. 84, under the head of “Premature Burial”:&mdash;</p>

<p>“A narrow escape of this was recently communicated
direct to the writer, and as it has some extremely important
bearings on the value of what are usually
considered to be evidences of death, we give it as
told by the survivor, who is still alive in the form of
a cheery and intelligent old lady in the fullest possession
of her faculties and memory.</p>

<p>“Herself the wife of a medical officer attached to
the&mdash;th Regiment, she was stationed at&mdash;&mdash; Island,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
where at the age of twenty-eight she was safely confined.
Shortly after this she was walking out with an attendant
when she was taken suddenly ill with a painful spasm
of the heart&mdash;what appears to have been an attack
of angina pectoris&mdash;and was conveyed in-doors and
propped up with pillows, suffering great pain, and
although medical attendance was summoned, nothing
was of avail, and she died&mdash;at least in the opinion of
those around her, who paid the proper attention to
what they regarded as a corpse. It was the custom
there to bury at sundown any one who died during
the day. We understand that in warm countries it is
difficult to close the eyelids properly, and so this lady,
lying motionless and rigid, contemplated with perfectly
clear perception, but with an utter indifference, the
bringing in of the coffin and the necessary preparations
for her interment; she remembers her children coming
to take a last look at her, and then being taken down
stairs.</p>

<p>“She would never have lived to tell the story but for an
accident, which happened in this way. Her nurse, who
was much attached to her, was stroking her face and the
muscles of her jaw, and presently declared she heard
a sound of breathing. Medical assistance was summoned,
and the mirror test applied, but the surface
was undimmed. Then, to make sure, they opened a
vein in each arm, but no blood flowed. No limb
responded to stimulus, and they declared that the
nurse was mistaken, and that the body was dead
beyond doubt.</p>

<p>“But the nurse persisted in her belief and in her
attentions, and did succeed in establishing a sign of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
life. Then mustard applications to her feet and to the
back of her neck, and burnt feathers applied to her
nostrils, which she remembered burning her nose,
completed her return to consciousness.”</p>

of simulation of death from fright occurred here on Saturday.
Mrs. Sarseville, the wife of a farmer in this county, was in the
cow-house attending to the dairy work when she saw a nest of
squirming snakes through a hole in the plank floor. She fell to
the ground apparently lifeless with fright. Help was summoned,
and she was carried into the house. Before the physician arrived
Mrs. Sarseville had begun to turn black, and he pronounced her
dead, giving a certificate,<span class="sidenote1">CERTIFICATE OF APOPLEXY.</span> in which he assigned apoplexy as the
cause. During the night Mrs. Sarseville’s daughter sat beside the
coffin of her mother, lamenting her death. Just before daybreak
she was startled to see the body move. She was more shocked
when her mother opened her eyes and sat bolt upright in her
coffin. The supposed corpse was no less startled than the girl to
find herself dressed in grave-clothes and lying in a coffin. Help
was summoned, and the lady helped out of her narrow bed and
into her ordinary clothes. She took breakfast with the family
yesterday morning, and seemed none the worse for her ghastly

the dead of Miss Eleanor Markham, a young woman of respectability,
who to all appearance had died on Sunday, July 8.</p>

<p>“Miss Markham about a fortnight ago complained of heart
trouble, and was treated by Dr. Howard. She grew weaker
gradually, and on Sunday morning apparently breathed her last,
to the great grief of her relatives, by whom she was much beloved.

<p>“After her relatives had taken the last look on what they supposed
was their beloved dead, the lid of the coffin was fastened on,
and the undertaker and his assistant took it to the hearse waiting
outside. As they approached the hearse a noise was heard, and
the coffin was put down and opened in short order. Behold! there
was poor Eleanor Markham lying on her back, her face white and
contorted, and her eyes distended.</p>

are burying me alive.’ ‘Hush! child,’ said Dr. Howard, who

<p>“The girl was then taken into the house and placed on the bed,

<p>“Sir,&mdash;To your interesting correspondence on ‘Buried Alive,’
I would add the following, which I had directly from the mouth of
one who but for the faithfulness of her husband would probably
have been added to the number. I knew her quite well. She was
the daughter of a physician in my native town, and her husband
was a professor of music, and I will tell the incident as nearly as
I can remember in her own words.<span class="sidenote1">A HUSBAND’S PROMISE.</span> She said:&mdash;‘I had in my
early married life a dread of there being any mistake made about
my death, and begged my husband that, should he survive me,
he would watch my body himself, which he promised he would do.
Some time after this, I was overtaken by a most terrible attack of
fever, succeeded by entire exhaustion, and I, as my attendants
believed, died, and was accordingly laid out for burial. My good
husband was true to his promise, and he, with my sister, watched
the corpse, and in the night they perceived some indication of
returning life, and of course means were used for restoration.’</p>

had brought up at the time I speak of a family of four sons and one
daughter, and she lived to a good old age.&mdash;Yours truly,</p>

<p class="p1">Speaking on the subject of premature burial the
other day, a well-known London publisher told the
author that he personally knew a lady, the daughter of
a British Consul, who had been taken for dead on two
separate occasions. On the first occasion the lady
had been placed in her coffin, and the lid screwed
down ready for interment. A friend who had known
the supposed deceased called to condole with the family,
and said:&mdash;“I should like to have a last look at dear
L&mdash;&mdash; if you will only permit me.” The lid was
accordingly removed, and the visitor detected, as it
seemed to her, signs of life in her friend; she was
taken out of her coffin, put in a warm bath, and
recovered. Some years later the same lady fell into
a cataleptic state after a fever, and was taken for dead.
Preparations had been made for the funeral in both
instances, but delayed beyond the usual time for interment.
She returned to consciousness, and is now
living.</p>

Cummings had given a certificate of his death. Frank

<p class="psh">AN ARMY SURGEON’S PERSONAL EXPERIENCE.</p>

<div class="sidenote1">DR. CHEW’S EXPERIENCES.</div>

<p>Dr. R. G. S. Chew, of Calcutta, writing to the
author, says:&mdash;“In 1873 I was a student in the
Bishop’s High School, Poonah (Bombay Presidency),
where I used to be generally at the head of my
class, and when competing for the Science Prizes I
was fully determined to take the first prize or none.
The Reverend&mdash;&mdash; Watson, Rector of St. Mary’s
Church and Chaplain to our school, knew my disposition,
and cautioned me against being too sanguine,
lest disappointment might tell very keenly. The disappointment
came, and with it much nervous excitability.
Shortly after this (Christmas, 1873) my favourite sister
was seized with convulsions that carried her off. From
the moment of her decease to nearly a month after her
interment I entirely lost the power of speech. On the
day of the funeral I was parched with thirst, but could
not drink, as the water seemed to choke me. My eyes
were burning and my head felt like bursting, but I
could neither sob nor cry. I felt quite dazed, and
followed the procession to the cemetery, where I stood
motionless by the open grave; but as soon as they
lowered the little coffin into its resting-place I threw
myself headlong into the grave and fainted away.
Some one pulled me out and carried me home, where
I lay in a sort of stupor for nine days, during which
Dr. Donaldson attended me most patiently, and I
regained consciousness, but was too weak to even sit
up in bed. On the 16th January, 1874, I felt a peculiar
sensation as of something filling up my throat&mdash;no swelling,
no pain nor anything that pointed to throat affection&mdash;and
this getting worse and worse, in spite of everything,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
I <i>died</i>, as was supposed, on the 18th of January, 1874,
and was laid out for burial, as the most careful examination
failed to show the slightest traces of life. I had
been in this state for twenty hours, and in another three
hours would have been closed up for ever, when my
eldest sister, who was leaning over the head of my coffin
crying over me, declared she saw my lips move. The
friends who had come to take their last look at me
tried to persuade her it was only fancy, but, as she persisted,
Dr. Donaldson was sent for to convince her that
I was really dead. For some unexplained reason he
had me taken out of the coffin and examined very
carefully from head to foot. Noticing a peculiar, soft
fluctuating swelling at the base of my neck, just where
the clavicles meet the sternum, he went to his brougham,
came back with his case of instruments, and, before any
one could stop him or ask what he was going to do,
laid open the tumour and plunged in a tracheotomy
tube, when a quantity of pus escaped, and, releasing the
pressure on the carotids and thyroid, was followed by a
rush of blood and some movement on my part that
startled the doctor. Restoratives were used, and I was
slowly nursed back to life; but the tracheotomy tube
(I <i>still</i> carry the scar) was not finally removed till
September, 1875.”</p>


<p class="pc1">“APPARENT DEATH FROM A FALL.<br />

<p>“A sowar&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, native trooper&mdash;of the 7th regiment
of cavalry, in 1878, carrying despatches at Nowshera,
was thrown from his horse, and, falling with his head
against a sharp stone in the road, rolled on to his
back, in which position he was found some six or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
seven hours after, and conveyed to the morgue of
the European Depôt Hospital pending removal to
the ‘lines’ of his own corps.<span class="sidenote1">APPARENT DEATH FROM A FALL.</span> There was very little
hæmorrhage, and the stone was still wedged in
between the temporo-parietal suture. Cardiac sounds
and respiratory murmurs could not be detected. The
limbs were perfectly rigid, and there was a good deal of
cadaveric ecchymosis to be distinctly seen. Nothing
would have convinced any one that the sowar was still
alive, and Surgeons-Major Hunter, Gibson, and Briggs,
Apothecary S. Pollock, Assistant-Surgeon J. Lewis and
myself <i>verily</i> believed he was stone-dead. As ‘cause of
death’ is what the army is exceedingly particular about,
Surgeon-Major Hunter removed the impacted stone
and lifted out portions of the fractured bone (prior to
holding a proper <i>post-mortem</i>), when to the surprise of
all of us ‘the corpse’ deliberately closed its eyes (which
were staring open when the body was first brought in),
and there was a slight serous hæmorrhage. On noticing
this, the sowar’s head was trephined&mdash;no chloroform or
other anæsthetic being used&mdash;some more fragments of
bone and a large blood-clot that pressed on the brain
were removed, and as the sowar repeatedly flinched
under this operation, a stimulant was poured down his
throat, and he was removed to his regimental hospital,
from which he was discharged ‘well’ some six months
and a half later. After this he did good service in the
Afghan and Egyptian campaigns.”</p>

for dead and placed in the mortuary to await burial.
When the porters entered some hours later to remove the
hundred or so bodies, they found this gentleman sitting
up in great pain, and very much frightened. He was
placed in a ward and recovered. About the same time
a little girl came to life actually at the graveside. She
had been brought in one of several four-horse vans that
conveyed bodies for interment in the Ohlsdorff grave-yard.
Fortunately for her, she had not been placed in
a coffin, the exigencies of the time rendering it impossible
to provide caskets for the dead. When the disease
began to die out, the people found time to ask&mdash;“Can
it be possible that life remains in any of the bodies
buried?” That the doctors in the latter days cut the
ulnar arteries of all subjects before passing them for
dead is full of significance.’”</p>

proceed from Rawal Pindi by bullock-train to Peshawur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
to join the various regiments we were to be posted to
for duty. We had just passed a place called Rati when
Borthwick showed strong symptoms of cholera, from
which he suffered all that night. The nearest hospital
was twenty-five miles behind us, and though we had
neither medicines nor sick-room comforts with us, we
had no alternative but to journey onwards, because the
train-drivers (Indians) refused to turn back, and if we
did return to Rawal Pindi we would have been court-martialled
for disobeying lawful commands and coming
back without orders to do so. Travelling by bullock-train
is very slow work, and far from a comfortable
mode of transit; however, we were obliged to make the
best of it, and early next morning Borthwick was cold,
stiff, and seemingly dead. Here was a fine state of affairs&mdash;the
nearest cantonment, which we had no expectation
of reaching (<i>i.e.</i>, Nowshera) before nine p.m., was thirty-six
miles off, and by the time we arrived at it, it would
have been too late to approach the authorities, while
Peshawur, our destination, was another twenty-nine miles
further off. Dispose of the body we dared not, and we
had no choice but to continue our route. All that day
there was not a movement or other sign to show that life
was not extinct, and affairs seemed no better by five p.m.
next day, when we reached Peshawur. The apparent
corpse was lifted out of the bullock-train and carried
into the hospital dispensary (where a strong fire was
blazing) preparatory to papers being signed and arrangements
made for its final disposal. Whether it was the
heat of the fire before which he was placed, or whether
the vibriones had produced an antitoxin, I am not prepared
to argue; but <i>we do know</i> that Borthwick recovered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
consciousness while lying on the bed in that dispensary,
and that he whom we mourned as dead returned to life.
He served in the same military stations with me in the
North-West Frontier till 1880, when he accompanied me
to the Calcutta Medical College, where we parted company
in February, 1882, I bound for Egypt and he for
frontier duty. At first we corresponded regularly, but
since 1885 we lost touch of each other.”</p>

<p class="psh">“REVIVAL IN A MORTUARY IN INDIA.</p>

<p>“Sergeant J. Clements Twining, of H.M.’s 109th
regiment of British infantry, located at Dinapoor in
1876, was brought in an unconscious state to the
hospital, supposed to be suffering from <i>coup de soleil</i>.
Everything that could be done was ineffectually tried
to rouse him from coma, and he was removed to the
dead-house to wait <i>post-mortem</i> next morning. At
two a.m. the sentry on the dead-house came rushing
down to the dispensary (about four hundred and
fifty yards off) declaring that he had seen and heard
a ghost in the dead-house, to which myself and the
compounder and dresser on duty at once proceeded,
to find that Clements Twining, who was now partially
conscious, was lying on the dead-house flags groaning
most piteously&mdash;he had rolled off the table on to the
floor. He returned to health, and in 1877 accompanied
his regiment to England, where I met him at Woolwich
in 1883, and he asked me to corroborate his story of
‘returning to life’ to certain of his acquaintances who
had refused to believe him.”</p>

<p class="pch">“CHOLERA CORPSES REVIVED IN A MORTUARY.</p>

<p>“When the East Norfolk regiment was out cholera-dodging
in 1878, Colour-Sergeant T. Hall and Corporal
W. Bellomy were sent into cantonments for burial as
cholera corpses in the Nowshera Cemetery.<span class="sidenote1">THE USE OF MORTUARIES.</span> There was
some delay in the interment owing to a difficulty in
obtaining the wood necessary for their coffins, so both
bodies were placed in the dead-house, which was generously
sprinkled with disinfectants to ward off the risk
of contagion. First Hall and then Bellomy regained
consciousness, and were duly returned to duty. The
following year Bellomy was ‘invalided’ to England,
where I understand he now enjoys the best of health.”</p>

<p>“Shortly after the Afghan war of 1878, Surgeon-Major
T. Barnwell and I were told off to take a large
number of time-expired men, invalids, and wounded, to
Deolali on their way to England. Some of the wounded
were in a very critical state, necessitating great care;
one man in particular, Trooper Holmes of the 10th
Hussars, who had an ugly bullet-wound running along
his left thigh and under the groin. Our only means of
transport for these poor fellows was the ‘palki’ or
doolie carried by four bearers at a curious swinging
pace. When we got to Nowshera, Holmes seemed on
a fair way to recovery, but the swinging of the doolie
seemed too much for him, and he grew weaker day by
day till we got to Hassan Abdool, when we could not
rouse him to take some nourishment before starting on
the march, and to all appearance he seemed perfectly
dead; but, as there was neither the time nor convenience
to hold a <i>post-mortem</i>, we carried the body on to ‘John
Nicholson,’ where, the same difficulties being in the way,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
and no facilities for burial, we were obliged to put the
<i>post-mortem</i> off for another day, and convey the corpse
to Rawal Pindi rest camp, where we laid him on the
floor of the mortuary tent and covered him over with
a tarpaulin. This was his salvation, as next morning
(<i>i.e.</i>, the third day succeeding his ‘death’), when we
raised the tarpaulin to hold the <i>post-mortem</i>, some
hundreds of field mice (these tracts are <i>noted</i> for them)
rushed out, and we noticed that Holmes was breathing,
though very slowly&mdash;five or six respirations to the
minute&mdash;and there were a few teeth marks where the
mice had attacked his calves. To prevent a relapse
by the jolting on further marches, we handed him over
to the station hospital staff, who pulled him round, and
then forwarded him to the headquarters of his regiment
at Meerut.”</p>

<p>A lady, distinguished alike for her literary gifts as
well as for her philanthropy, sends me the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>“I am much obliged to you for sending me ‘Perils.’
It is a terrible subject, and one that has haunted me all
my life, insomuch that I have never made a will without
inserting a clause requiring my throat to be cut before
I am put underground. Of course one can have no
reliance on doctors whatever, and I have myself known
a case in which a very eminent one insisted on a coffin
being screwed down because the corpse looked so life-like
and full of colour that the friends could not help
indulging in hopes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CASES IN IRELAND.</div>

<p>“My great grandmother, after whom I am called, a
famous heiress, was a notable case of narrow escape. As
a girl she passed into a state of apparent death, and a great
funeral was ordered for her. Among the guests came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
a young girl friend, who insisted that she was not dead,
and raised such a stir that the funeral was postponed,
and time was allowed to pass till the marvel became
that there were no signs of change. I could never
ascertain how long this comatose state lasted before
she recovered; but she <i>did</i> recover, so thoroughly that
after her marriage with Richard Trench, of Garbuly, she
became the mother of twenty-two children. Obviously
this was no case of a feeble, hysterical, cataleptic subject.
I will enclose photograph taken from a miniature of her
in a ring in my possession.</p>

<p>“There was another case, well known in Ireland in
my youth, of a Colonel Howard, who had a fine place (I
think it was called Castle Howard) in Wicklow. He
was supposed to be dead, and a lead coffin was actually
made with his name and date of death on it; after which
Colonel Howard came to life, and had the plate of the
coffin fixed over his kitchen chimney as a warning to
his servants not to bury people in a hurry.”</p>

<p>Dr. Colin S. Valentine, LL.D., Principal of the
Medical Missionary Training College, Agra, N.W.P., told
the author during his visit to Agra, February, 1896, that
Captain Young, an officer in the regiment of which
he (Dr. Valentine) was at that time army surgeon, who
had been dreadfully mauled while tiger-hunting in
Madras, was laid out for dead, and all the arrangements
were made for his funeral at six o’clock that
evening, when consciousness returned, and he lived for
twenty years after.</p>

<p>In a lecture on “Signs of Death and Disposal of the
Dead,” delivered by Dr. A. Stephenson at Nottingham,
January 9, 1896, the lecturer said “he once attended a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
girl living in that locality who was in a trance. All the
preparations were made for her funeral, and the grave
ordered. She remained in a trance three days, and her
mother was annoyed because he would not sign her
death-certificate. On the third day she slowly rose and
recovered. The girl would have been buried unless he
had had a very great fear of her being buried alive.”<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>From the London <i>Echo</i>, March 3, 1896.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="pc1">“NARROW ESCAPE OF A GREEK-ORTHODOX METROPOLITAN.</p>

<p>“A letter from Constantinople, in the <i>Politische Korrespondenz</i>,
gives a remarkable case of an apparent death which would have
ended in a premature burial but for the high ecclesiastical position
of the person concerned. On the 3rd of this month, Nicephorus
Glycas, the Greek-Orthodox Metropolitan of Lesbos, an old man
in his eightieth year, after several days of confinement to his bed,
was reported by the physician to be dead. The supposed dead
bishop, in accordance with the rules of the Orthodox Church, was
immediately clothed in his episcopal vestments, and placed upon
the Metropolitan’s throne in the great church of Methymni, where
the body was exposed to the devout faithful during the day, and
watched by relays of priests day and night. Crowds streamed
into the church to take a last look at their venerable chief pastor.
On the second night of “the exposition of the corpse,” the Metropolitan
suddenly started up from his seat and stared round him
with amazement and horror at all the panoply of death amidst
which he had been seated. The priests were not less horrified
when the ‘dead’ bishop demanded what they were doing with
him? The old man had simply fallen into a death-like lethargy,
which the incompetent doctors had hastily concluded to be death.
He is now as hale and hearty as can well be expected from an
octogenarian. But here it is that the moral comes in. If
Nicephorus Glycas had been a layman he would most certainly
have been buried alive. Fortunately for him the Canon Law of
the Orthodox Church does not allow a bishop to be buried earlier<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
than the third day after his death; whereas a layman, according
to the ancient Eastern custom, is generally buried about twelve
hours after death has been certified. The excitement which has
been aroused by the prelate’s startling resurrection may tend to
set men thinking more seriously about the frequent probability
of the cruel horror of the interment of living persons.”</p></div>

<p class="pc1">The above-mentioned facts have been authenticated
for the author by Dr. Franz Hartmann, of Hallein,
Austria.</p>

<p class="psh">NARROW ESCAPES OF SMALL-POX PATIENTS.</p>

<p>Many physicians who dispute the frequency of premature
burials admit that the liability to such catastrophes
is considerable during epidemics of small-pox, where
extreme exhaustion, amounting to a suspension of life,
is distinguishable from actual death only by patient and
prolonged observation.</p>

<p>From the <i>Lancet</i>, June 21, 1884, p. 1150:&mdash;</p>


<div class="pc1">

<p class="pc1">“SUSPENDED ANIMATION AFTER SMALL-POX.</p>

<p>“Sir,&mdash;I send you privately names and addresses by means of
which you can test, if you please, the accuracy of the following
statements, which I forward for insertion in your journal:&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote">APPARENT DEATHS AFTER SMALL-POX.</div>

<p>“Some years since, a young man who had been attacked by
small-pox was declared by the medical man to be dead, and was
laid out for burial. The nurse, however, on paying a visit to the
supposed corpse, thinking there was something uncorpse-like about
its appearance, put a wine-glass over the mouth, and returning in a
quarter of an hour, found it dimmed with breath. He was resuscitated,
and, so far as I am aware, is still living. He would now be
about forty-five. He is a farmer.</p>

<p>“A mother and her baby were ill of small-pox, and seemed
likely to die. The grandmother, however, made the nurse promise
that if death appeared to ensue, and even if the medical man
pronounced either or both to be dead, she would put additional<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
blankets on the one or both, and leave them so till her (the grandmother’s)
return, which would not be till the next day. They both
appeared to die, and were declared dead by the doctor; but the
nurse did as she had promised, and the next day when the grandmother
returned, they were both alive, and were both living not
very long since.</p>

<p>“Some twenty years ago, I was told that about forty years
previously a young man, in a parish where I was acquainted, was
put in a coffin as a person dead of small-pox; but when the bell
was tolling for his funeral, and he was about to be ‘screwed down,’
he got up and vacated the coffin, and lived several years afterwards.</p>

<p>“In a town where I was brought up, a woman was nearly buried
alive through having gone into a trance on being frightened by a
young lady who had put on a white sheet and pretended to be a
‘ghost.’ For years she was liable to long spells of insensibility,
from which nothing could rouse her.</p>

<p>“The haste with which small-pox corpses are disposed of
nowadays is to be deprecated. They are usually buried within
twelve hours of their supposed death, and the cases I first
mentioned show with what very probable results. The only sure
proof of death is decomposition, and a law ought to be passed
forbidding burial until signs of it have appeared. Not very long
since I was in a church-yard where a drain was being made round
the church, and was not a little struck by the horrified look of a
labourer who came to the vicar and stated that they had come on
a skull face downward, which, he said, put it beyond doubt that
the person it had belonged to had turned in his coffin after burial.&mdash;I

<div class="pbq">

<div class="sidenote1">REV. HARRY JONES’ CASES.</div>

<p class="p1">“The Reverend Harry Jones, in his reminiscences, and as a
London clergyman, declares his conviction that in times of panic
from fatal epidemics it is not unlikely that some people are buried
alive. Mr. Jones recalls a case within his knowledge of a young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
woman pronounced to be dead from cholera, and actually laid out
for the usual collecting cart to call from the undertakers, when a
neighbour happened to come in and lament over her. The story
continues thus: ‘And is poor Sarah really dead?’ she cried.
‘Well,’ said her mother, ‘she is, and she will soon be fetched
away; but if you can do anything you may do it.’ Acting on this
permission the practical neighbour set about rubbing Sarah profusely
with mustard. Sarah sat up, stung into renovated life, and
so far recovered as to marry; ‘and I myself,’ says Mr. Jones,
‘christened four or five of her children in the course of the next
few years.’ In another case, within Mr. Jones’ parochial experiences
in London, a man employed as potman lay <i>in extremis</i>. A
doctor was called in, who said ‘Turn him on his face, and I will
put a thick strip of flannel soaked in spirits of wine down his
spine. We will see what that will do.’ A sister brought a store
of flannel, the doctor soaked it in spirit, and prepared to apply it
as he proposed. First, however, he placed the soaking mass in
a heap (almost as big as a small hassock) in the middle of his
back. Meanwhile the sister leant forward with a candle and
accidently set the hassock on fire. ‘This,’ adds the anecdotist,
‘woke the potman up;’ and not very long ago the doctor told me
he had seen him in a street near the Oxford Circus.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">From the <i>Daily Chronicle</i>, September 19, 1895.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“Sir,&mdash;I infer from the following facts that numbers of persons
are buried alive after being supposed to have succumbed to small-pox.</p>

<p>“Some years ago, at St. Paul’s, Belchamp, near Clare, a young
man who had been down with the small-pox was pronounced to be
dead, and was put into a coffin, which, fortunately, was left unclosed
until after the bell began to toll for his funeral, when he
rose and stepped out. He lived for many years after. In the same
neighbourhood no less than three other similar cases occurred,
saving that the undertakers were not so far forward in their work.
Each of these would have been buried alive but for the facts that
in one case the nurse, having suspicions, put a wine-glass over the
mouth of the person (who had been already ‘laid out’), and on
returning in a quarter of an hour found it dimmed with breath;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
and that in the other case the mother of a mother, who with her
baby was declared by the doctor to be dead, had blankets heaped
on them, and after a while had the satisfaction of seeing them
revive. Two of these three persons are, I believe, still living, and
would be just past middle-age. I enclose their names for your
private perusal, that you may verify my statements if desired.
The first-mentioned case happened about seventy years ago, but
I heard of it from residents in the neighbourhood about forty years
after it occurred.</p>

<p>“Nowadays as soon as a small-pox patient is supposed to be
dead, he or she is enclosed in a coffin and hurried off to the
church-yard or cemetery the ensuing night&mdash;at least this is the
practice in country places. I have no doubt that many have been
buried alive.&mdash;Yours faithfully,</p>

<p class="p1">Brigade-Surgeon W. Curran cites from the <i>Revue des
Deux Mondes</i>, April, 1873, in his Eighth Paper, entitled
“Buried Alive,” as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>“On the 15th of October, 1842, a farmer who lived
in the suburbs of Neufchâtel (Lower Seine) went to
sleep in his hay-loft in the midst of some newly mown
hay. As he did not get up at the usual hour the next
morning, his wife went to call him, and found him dead.
When the time for his funeral arrived, some twenty-four
or thirty hours subsequently, those who were charged
with the burial put the body on a bier, and having
placed this on the ladder that communicated between
the ground and the loft, they allowed it to slide down.
<span class="sidenote">IMPORTANCE OF CAREFUL EXAMINATION.</span>All of a sudden one of the rungs of this ladder gave
way, and the bier, falling through, was dashed violently
on the pavement below. The shock, which might have
been fatal to a live person, proved to be the ‘saving
clause’ of our supposed dead one; and fortunately, too,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
the attendants had not, as so commonly happens in
such contingencies, absconded; on the contrary, responding
without delay to the requirements of the
situation, they quickly realised the gravity of the crisis,
and, unbinding the shrouds of the farmer, they soon
restored him to consciousness and life. He was able,
we are further told, to resume his ordinary duties in
a few days afterwards.”<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>The <i>Undertakers’ and Funeral Directors’ Journal</i>,
January 22, 1889, says:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Mr. J. W. Smith, of 158 River Avenue, Alleghany”
has just had, for instance, a remarkably narrow escape
of prematurely putting his family in mourning, and one
which will, we may be sure, be a very disagreeable recollection
for him during the rest of his existence.
After a visit to the Pittsburg Opera House one night,
Mr. Smith was found lying ‘stiff and cold’ behind the
stove in the dining-room, and apparently dead. A
superficial examination by Dr. M’Cready confirmed the
worst fears of Mrs. Smith, but subsequently the doctor
sought carefully for any little spark of life which might
lurk unseen, and, very fortunately for Mr. Smith, found
it. But, beyond that, nothing could be accomplished;
no effort to restore animation produced the slightest
effect. Two other physicians were then summoned;
but neither attempts at bleeding, the use of ‘mustard
baths,’ nor the application of electricity, could rouse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
Mr. Smith after his visit to the opera. For three weeks
he lay insensible, and when he regained consciousness
a fever followed. This event, and some others of a
similar character which are occasionally heard of, show
that the examination of persons apparently dead should
always be undertaken by an efficient person, and by no
means in a perfunctory manner.”</p>

<p>The late Madame Blavatsky was subject to death-like
trances, and Dr. Franz Hartmann informs me that
she would have been buried alive if Colonel Olcott had
not telegraphed to let her have time to awaken.</p>

<p class="pch">FORMALITIES AND THEIR FATAL CONSEQUENCES.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Whenever</span> grave-yards have been removed, owing to
the rapid expansion of towns, in America, or examined
elsewhere, unmistakable evidences of premature burial
have been disclosed, as will be seen in this volume;
bodies have been found turned upon their faces, the
limbs contorted, with hair dishevelled, the clothing torn,
the flesh mutilated, and coffins broken by the inmates
in their mad endeavour to escape after returning consciousness,
to terminate life only in unspeakable mental
and physical agonies. It may be said that every grave-yard
has its traditions, but the facts are carefully concealed
lest they should reach the ears of the relatives, or
incriminate the doctors who had with such confidence
certified to actual deaths which were only apparent. It
is not, however, the custom to remove grave-yards in
Europe until all possibility of such discoveries has disappeared.
To reopen a grave is to break the seal of
domestic grief. There is a widespread belief that where
a coffin, with a duly certified corpse,&mdash;dead or alive,&mdash;has
been screwed up, it must not be opened without an
authorisation from a magistrate, mayor, or other official,
and many people have been suffocated in their coffins
while waiting for this formality. Common sense, under
the circumstances, seems to be often paralysed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>In England it has been decided, Reg. <i>v.</i> Sharpe
(1 Dearsley and Bell, 160), to be a misdemeanour to
disinter a body without lawful authority, even where the
motive of the offender was pious and laudable; and a too
rigorous interpretation of this and similar enactments
in other countries has led to the suffocation of many
unfortunate victims of a mistaken medical diagnosis,
whose lives, by prompt interposition, might have been
saved.</p>

<p>Köppen, in his work, entitled “Information Relative
to Persons who have been Buried Alive,” Halle, 1799,
dedicated to His Majesty the King of Prussia, Frederick
William III., quotes the following amongst a large
number of cases of premature burial:&mdash;“In D&mdash;&mdash;, the
Baroness F&mdash;&mdash; died of small-pox. She was kept in
her house three days, and then put in the family
vault. After a time, a noise of knocking was heard
in the vault, and the voice of the Baroness was also
heard. The authorities were informed; and instead of
opening the door with an axe, as could have been done,
the key was sent for, which took three or four hours
before the messenger returned with it. On opening the
vault it was found that the lady was lying on her side,
with evidences of having suffered terrible agony.”</p>

<p>Struve, in his essay on “Suspended Animation,” 1803,
p. 71, relates the following:&mdash;“A beggar arrived late at
night, and almost frozen to death, at a German village,
and, observing a school-house open, resolved to sleep
there. The next morning, the school-boys found the
poor man sitting motionless in the room, and hastened,
affrighted, to inform the schoolmaster of what they had
seen. The villagers, supposing the beggar to be dead,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
interred him in the evening. During the night, the
watchman heard a knocking in the grave, accompanied
by lamentations. He gave information to the bailiff of
the village, who declined to listen to his tale. Soon
afterwards the watchman returned to the grave, and
again heard a hollow noise, interrupted by sighs. He
once more hastened to the magistrate, earnestly soliciting
him to cause the grave to be opened; but the latter,
being irresolute, delayed this measure till the next morning,
when he applied to the sheriff, who lived at a distance
from the village, in order to obtain the necessary directions.
He was, however, obliged to wait some time
before an interview took place.<span class="sidenote">A MAGISTRATE CENSURED.</span> The more judicious
sheriff severely censured the magistrate for not having
opened the grave on the information from the watchman,
and desired him to return and cause it to be opened
without delay. On his arrival, the grave was immediately
opened; but, just Heaven! what a sight! The
poor, wretched man, after having recovered in the grave,
had expired for want of air. In his anguish and desperation
he had torn the flesh from his arms. All the
spectators were struck with horror at this dreadful
scene.”</p>

<p class="p1">The <i>Undertakers’ Journal</i>, November 22, 1880, relates
the following:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“An extraordinary story is reported from Tredegar, South Wales.
A man was buried at Cefn Golan Cemetery, and it is alleged that
some of those who took part in carrying the body to the burial-ground
heard knocking inside the coffin. No notice was taken of
the affair at the time, but it has now come up again, and the
rumour has caused a painful sensation throughout the district. It
is stated that application has been made to the Home Secretary
for permission to exhume the body.”</p>

10 and 44, relates the two following cases:&mdash;“In the
year 1856 a man died in an Hungarian village. It is
customary there to dig the graves in rows. As the
grave-digger was making the new grave he heard sounds
as of knocking proceeding from a grave where a man
had been buried a few days previously. Terrified, he
went to the priest, and with the priest to the police.
At last permission was granted to open the grave; but
by that time its occupant had died in reality. The fact
that he had been buried alive was made evident by the
condition of the body, and by the wounds which the
man had inflicted upon himself by biting his shoulders
and arms.</p>

<p>“In a small town in Prussia, an undertaker, living
within the limits of the cemetery, heard during the
night cries proceeding from within a grave in which
a person had been buried on the previous day. Not
daring to interfere without permission, he went to the
police and reported the matter. When, after a great
deal of delay, the required formalities were fulfilled and
permission granted to open the grave, it was found that
the man had been buried alive, but that he was now
dead. His body, which had been cold at the time of
the funeral, was now warm and bleeding from many
wounds, where he had skinned his hands and head in
his struggles to free himself before suffocation made an
end to his misery.”</p>

<p>A medical correspondent communicates to the author
particulars of the following case, which occurred at Salzburg,
Austria:&mdash;“Some children were playing in the
Luzergasse Cemetery, and their attention was attracted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
by knocking sounds in a newly-made grave. They
informed the grave-digger of it, and he secured permission
to open the grave from whence the sounds seemed
to come. A man had been buried there at two p.m.
that day. The formalities of the permission to open the
grave delayed it till seven p.m., when, on opening the
coffin, the body was found to be bent completely over
forwards, and was frightfully distorted and bleeding from
places on the hands and arms, which seemed to have
been gnawed by the man’s own teeth. The medical
experts who were called in to examine the case declared
that the man had been buried alive.”</p>

<p>From the <i>Undertakers’ and Funeral Directors’ Journal</i>,
January 22, 1887.</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Another shocking case of premature burial is reported; the
distressing incident took place at Saumur, in France. A young
man suddenly died, at least to all appearance, and his burial was
ordered to take place as soon as possible. The <i>croquemorts</i>, or
undertaker’s men, who carried the coffin to the grave, thought
they heard a noise like knocking under its lid, yet, being afraid of
creating a panic among the people who attended the funeral, they
went on with their burden.<span class="sidenote1">FATAL RESULTS.</span> The coffin was duly placed in the
grave, but, as the earth was being thrown upon it, unmistakable
sounds of knocking were heard by everybody. The mayor,
however, had to be sent for before the coffin could be opened,
and some delay occurred in the arrival of that official. When
the lid was removed, the horrible discovery was made that the
unfortunate inmate had only just died from asphyxia. The conviction
is spreading that the terrible French law requiring speedy
interment ought to be modified without delay.”</p>

<p class="p1">Mr. William Harbutt, School of Art, Bath, writes to
me, November 27, 1895:&mdash;“The copies of the pamphlet
‘The Perils of Premature Burial,’ by Professor Alex.
Wilder, you kindly sent me are in circulation. Almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
every one to whom I mention the subject knows some
instances. One, a case at Radstock, twelve miles from
Bath, where the bearers at the funeral heard noises
inside the coffin, but were afraid to open it without the
authority from a magistrate. When it was opened next
day the appearance of the body showed that he had
been coffined alive, and had had a terrible struggle to
escape.”</p>

<p class="pc1">“A WOMAN LOSES HER LIFE THROUGH LEGAL FORMALITIES.</p>

<p class="pr2">“Paris, May 11.</p>

<p>“A woman who was believed to have died the day before was
being buried at Doussard, when the grave-digger, who was engaged
in filling up the grave, distinctly heard knocking coming
from the coffin. He called a man who was working near, and he
came and listened, and heard the knocking also. It was then
about nine o’clock in the morning. The knocking continued, and
they listened for about half an hour, when it occurred to one of
them that they ought to do something, so they went to inform the
local authorities. The curé of the village was the first to arrive
on the scene; but as no one had any authority to exhume the body
the coffin was not taken up. All that was done was to bore some
holes in the lid with a drill in such a way as to admit of air. By
mid-day all the necessary formalities had been gone through, and
it was decided at last to open the coffin. This was done; but
whether the unfortunate woman was still alive at this time is
doubtful. Some of those present affirm that she was. They state
that they saw a little colour come into her cheeks, and the eyes
open and shut. One thing is certain&mdash;viz.: that when at half-past
six in the evening it was finally decided to consult a doctor, the
practitioner summoned declared that death had taken place not
more than five or six hours before. It was thought that had the
coffin been opened directly the sounds were heard the woman’s
life might have been saved, and she would have been spared
hours of indescribable torture and suffering.”</p></div>

the other day, has almost found a pendant at Limoges. A
woman, belonging to the village of Laterie, died, to all appearance
at least, a few days ago. After the body had been placed in a
coffin, it was transported to the village church. On the way the
bearers heard sounds proceeding from it, and at once sent for the
mayor, who ordered it to be opened. The woman was found to
be suffering from <i>eclampsia</i>, which had been mistaken for death
by her relatives.”</p>

[From the <i>Spectator</i>, October 19, 1895.]</p>

<p>“Sir,&mdash;<i>Apropos</i> of your article and the correspondence about
being buried alive, in the <i>Spectator</i> of September 28, the enclosed
may interest you. It is an extract which I have copied to-day
out of a letter to a neighbour of mine from his brother in Ireland,
dated October 6, 1895:&mdash;‘About three weeks ago, our kitchen-maid
asked leave to go away for two or three days to see her
mother, who was dying. She came back again on a Friday or
Saturday, saying her mother was dead and buried. On Wednesday
she got a letter saying her mother had been dug up, and was alive
and getting all right. So she went up to see her, and sure enough
there she was “right enough,” as G&mdash;&mdash; says, having got out of
her trance, and knowing nothing about being in her grave from
Saturday till Tuesday. The only thing she missed was her <i>rings</i>;
she could not make out where they had got to. Her daughter, it
seems, told the doctor on her way back here that it struck her that
her mother had never got stiff after death, and she could not help
thinking it was very odd; and it made her very uncomfortable.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
He never said a word: and the kitchen-maid heard nothing until
she got the letter saying her mother was back again and alive.
Luckily, she did not “come to” until she had been taken out of
her coffin. It was a “rum go” altogether. They say exactly the
same thing happened to a sister of hers who is now alive and
well.’&mdash;I am, Sir, etc.,</p>

<p class="pch">PROBABLE CASES OF PREMATURE BURIAL.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> is a great and natural reluctance on the part of
medical practitioners to admit that they have made
mistakes in death-certification, particularly in any one
of the various forms of death counterfeits, or suspended
animation. It should be noted that amongst the lectures
delivered on special occasions, such as the opening of the
medical schools, the subjects of trance and the danger of
premature burial are conspicuous for their absence; allusion
to these subjects is of rare occurrence, nor does the
study of this abstruse branch of medicine, so far as can
be ascertained, form part of any medical curriculum. In
the bibliography at the end of this volume, extensive as
it is, I can hardly refer to a single instance. Dr. Franz
Hartmann, whose work on “Buried Alive” has passed
through two English and one German edition, informs
me that the same reticence is observable in the medical
schools of Germany. Many medical men do not believe
in death-trance. They declare that they have never
seen such a case, and in their judgment when a sick
patient ceases to breathe, when volition is suspended,
and the stethoscope reveals no signs of cardiac action,
the death is real, and the case beyond recovery. The
evidence disclosed in this volume is the result of inquiry
in many countries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>From the <i>Medical Times</i>, London, 1860, vol. i.,
p. 65.</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“A lady entering upon the ninth month of pregnancy died of
pneumonia. All the other phenomena of death ensued, except
that the colour of the face was unusually life-like. On the fifteenth
day from that of death there was not the least cadaveric odour
from the corpse, nor had its appearance much altered, and it was
only on the sixteenth day that the lips darkened. The temperature
of the atmosphere had undergone many changes during the time
mentioned, but although there had been frost for a short period,
the weather was in general damp and cold.”</p>

<p class="p1">This lady might not have been dead. The burial
laws should have been such as to make it certain that
she was dead before interment, by the appearance of
general decomposition.<span class="sidenote">NEIGHBOURS’ INTERFERENCE.</span> The examination of facts
collected by well-known physicians at home leads to
the conclusion that cases of narrow escapes from
premature burial are by no means of rare occurrence.
And it must be obvious to the least reflective reader
that in countries where burial follows quickly upon
supposed death (as in Turkey and France, some parts of
Ireland, and throughout India), or where there is no
compulsory examination of the dead (as in the United
States or the United Kingdom), and amongst people
like the Jews (since the Jewish Law enjoins speedy
interment), and especially in cases of sudden death
(where attempts at resuscitation are rare), the number
of premature burials may be considerable.</p>

<p>In the United States, while there is no law, as in
France, enforcing burial within a prescribed number
of days, it is the custom of civil authorities, under
regulations made by the Boards of Health, to compel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
interments if delayed by reason of doubt as to actual
death beyond a few days.</p>

<p>Particulars of the following case were sent me by a
physician, January 17, 1894:&mdash;</p>


<div class="pbq">

<p class="pc1">“WAS SHE ALIVE?</p>

<p>“Mrs. John Emmons, of North Judson, Ind., was taken suddenly
ill and apparently died, a week ago. Her husband desired to keep
the body for a few days, to make sure of death. It seems that her
mother went into a trance for four days, rallied, and lived five
years; also that her grandfather on her mother’s side, after having
been pronounced dead for six days, awoke, and lived for twenty-three
years. Mrs. Emmons’s body was kept until Saturday, when,
on the demand of the physician and numerous residents, it was
interred. During the time between Monday and Saturday the
body did not become rigid. Mortification did not set in, and she
was laid to rest without waiting for that, the surest of all tests, to
take place. Many are of the opinion that the woman has been
buried alive.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">There are many cases like the above on record, in
which, although there is no absolute proof of premature
burial, there is strong presumptive evidence of it.
The following from <i>Truth</i> (London) of May 23, 1895,
is an example, and the writer has heard of many
others:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“The other day I gave a story showing the difficulty of obtaining
a <i>post-mortem</i> examination after a doctor has once certified the
cause of death. One of my readers caps it with a gruesome
narrative, of which this is the outline: A man lately died in
London. The coffin had to be removed by rail, and was to be
closed on the fourth day after the death. My informant, taking a
last look at the deceased, was struck by the complete absence of
all the ordinary signs of death at such a period. In particular, he
states that there was no rigidity in any part of the body, and there
was a perceptible tinge of colour in the forehead. He went over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
to the doctor who had attended the deceased, described all the
signs that he had observed, and begged the doctor to come and
look at the body before the coffin was closed. The doctor absolutely
refused, saying that he had given his certificate, and had no
doubt as to the man’s death. The friend then suggested that he
might himself open a vein and see if blood flowed, to which the
doctor replied that, if he did so without the authority of the widow,
he would be indictable for felony. Whereupon, says my informant,
who was only a friend of the family, ‘I had to retire baffled, and
let matters take their course.’ Why on earth he did not take the
widow into his confidence, or risk an indictment for felony by
opening a vein on his own account, or even summon another
doctor, he does not say. I trust that, should any friend of mine
see my coffin about to be screwed down under similar circumstances,
and find equal cause to doubt whether I am dead, he
will summon up courage to stick a pin into me, and chance the
consequences. This, however, has nothing to do with the doctor’s
responsibilities. It would seem that the medico in this case was
either so confident in his own opinion as to decline even to
walk across the road to investigate the extraordinary symptoms
described to him, or else that he preferred the chance of the
man being buried alive to the chance of having to admit he
had made a mistake. Which alternative is the worst I do not
know.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">The <i>Gaulois</i> (Paris) of May 16, 1894, contains the
following:&mdash;</p>


<div class="pbq">

<p class="pc1">“DEATH OR CATALEPSY?</p>

<p>“The funeral of the Comtesse de Jarnac, whose death was
reported to have taken place on Saturday, was fixed for to-morrow,
but it will probably be postponed. None of the usual
signs of dissolution have appeared; the face still retains its colour,
and <i>rigor mortis</i> has not yet set in. Some hope is even entertained
that the Comtesse may be simply in a state of catalepsy,
and that the embolus, to which death was attributed, may have
lodged in the lungs, not in the heart, in which case it may merely
have caused a stoppage of the circulation (<i>sic</i>). The body had not
been placed in the coffin up to a late hour last night.”</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p class="psh">STRANGULATION BY A SCARF.</p>

<p>One of the authors was present on May 14, 1894,
with a company of ladies and gentlemen gathered at
a country mansion in the Austrian Tyrol for afternoon
tea, when the conversation turned upon the subject of
premature burial.<span class="sidenote">CASE IN THE AUSTRIAN TYROL.</span> Among other cases related, the host
described that of one of his servants, a woman, who
went to bed with toothache, a long scarf being wrapped
around her face and neck. As she did not appear the
following morning, our host entered her room, and
found her, as he supposed, strangled to death by the
scarf tightly wound about her neck. A doctor was
summoned, when he found that the woman was warm
and limp, her face soft and coloured as in life; yet, as
there was no respiration or perceptible wrist-pulse, nor
beating of the heart, he regarded her as dead, and
thought it would be proper to bury her. The host had
doubts, however, about the case, and, having decided to
observe it further, he had the woman removed to an outhouse,
where she remained three days longer without
any change in her appearance or condition in any way.
But, as there was considerable impatience felt at the
delay of the burial by the people on the estate, the host
sent for two doctors to make a final examination of the
woman, and decide as to the existence of life or death.
The doctors found that no change had taken place&mdash;there
was softness of the skin, colour in the face, limpness
of the muscles, and an unmistakable warmth of the
body; but, as there was an absence of apparent respiration
and beating of the heart, they decided that the
woman was dead, and urged her burial, which was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
done. They attributed the high temperature to the
process of decomposition which they assumed was going
on, though there was no odour of putrefaction noticed
by anyone.</p>

<p>The probabilities are that this woman was buried
alive. And in the present state of medical education
on the subject of apparent death and the causes that
bring it about, many physicians would have come to
a like conclusion; and, as physicians know but little
about it, they are not on their guard concerning its
dangers.</p>

<p>A number of cases of apparent death that have
survived&mdash;where there was strangulation from a scarf,
as in this case&mdash;have been reported. The explanation
in such cases is, that the pressure of the scarf around
the neck keeps the venous blood from flowing down
from the brain through the jugular veins, and the brain,
in consequence, becomes saturated with carbonic acid
gas from the detained venous blood, and a death-like
stupor caused by carbonic acid poisoning ensues.
Artificial respiration would, it is believed, restore such
persons to consciousness.</p>

<div class="sidenote">AN UNDERTAKER’S EXPERIENCE.</div>

<p>A leading West End undertaker, whose letter is
before me, writes under date of June 26, 1896, as
follows:&mdash;“In my experience I have had but one case
come under my personal observation where I had real
uncertainty as to death being actually present, and that
was an instance of the kind in which this calamity is
only likely, in my opinion, to occur. A girl who had
been to work in Borwick’s factory apparently fainted
and died, and within a few days the friends buried her.
When we came to close the coffin, there was no evidence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
of death, and we did not close it without having a doctor
sent for, and receiving his assurance that she was dead.
When reading the fatal cases which have come to light
upon this subject, I must confess to looking back upon
that instance with much fear, and it is but a poor consolation
to me that the responsibility was not mine, but
the medical man’s.”</p>

<p>The foregoing cases are recorded because they are
types of a class that nearly every physician, undertaker,
clergyman, or other observer has met with or heard of,
and the probabilities, having regard to the existing confusion
and uncertainty of opinion on the signs of death,
are on the side of apparent rather than real death. On
the other hand, a medical correspondent informs the
author that he is sceptical as to the reported cases of
narrow escapes, as on more than one occasion his efforts
to verify the facts have proved abortive. It must be
admitted that there are difficulties in the way of such
inquiries. If the subject of trance, or narrow escape
from burial, is a lady, publicity injures her prospects of
marriage, and, if a young man, his reputation for business
stability is endangered or prejudiced, so that this
reticence on the part of relatives is hardly surprising.
Such persons do not like their gruesome and unpleasant
experiences to be talked about.</p>

<p class="pch">PREDISPOSING CAUSES AND CONDITIONS OF DEATH-COUNTERFEITS.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Those</span> who are most subject to the various forms of
death-counterfeit are persons whose vocations exhaust
the nervous force faster than the natural powers of
recuperation, and who resort to narcotics and stimulants
to counteract the consequent physical depression. Dr.
Alex. Wilder, in his “Perils of Premature Burial,”
London, E. W. Allen, p. 19, says:&mdash;“We exhaust our
energies by overwork, by excitement, too much fatigue
of the brain, the use of tobacco, and sedatives or anæsthetics,
and by habits and practices which hasten the
Three Sisters in spinning the fatal thread. Apoplexy,
palsy, epilepsy, are likely to prostrate any of us at any
moment, and catalepsy, perhaps, is not very far from
any of us.” Equally, if not even more likely, to be
overtaken by these simulacra of death are the poor&mdash;the
ill-fed, ill-conditioned, and overworked classes.</p>

<p>With regard to the causation of catalepsy, Dr. W. R.
Gowers, in Quain’s “Dictionary of Medicine,” p. 216,
says:&mdash;“Nervous exhaustion is the common predisponent;
and emotional disturbance, especially religious
excitement, or sudden alarm, and blows on the head and
back, are frequent immediate causes. It occasionally
occurs in the course of mental affections, and especially
melancholia, and as an early symptom of epilepsy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p class="psh">FAINTING FITS.</p>

<p>Dr. James Curry, F.A.S., in his “Observations on
Apparent Death,” pp. 81, 82, referring to those conditions
and diseases which predispose to death-counterfeits,
to which women are more liable than
men, says:&mdash;“The faintings which most require assistance,
and to which, therefore, I wish particularly to
direct the attention of my readers and the public, are
those that take place from loss of blood, violent and
long-continued fits of coughing, excessive vomiting or
purging, great fatigue or want of food, and likewise
after convulsions, and in the advanced stage of low
fevers. It is but seldom, however, that any attempt at
recovery is made in such cases; and several reasons may
be assigned for this, particularly the great resemblance
that fainting fits of any duration bear to <i>actual death</i>, and
the firm belief of the bystanders that the circumstances
which preceded were sufficient to destroy life entirely.”</p>

<p>The author continues, pp. 106, 107:&mdash;“Nervous and
highly hysterical females, who are subject to fainting
fits, are the most frequent subjects of this kind of
apparent death; in which the person seems in a state
very nearly resembling that of hibernating animals, such
as the dormouse, bat, toad, frog, etc., which annually
become insensible, motionless, and apparently dead, on
the setting in of the winter’s cold, but spontaneously
revive on the returning warmth of spring. Here, by
some peculiar and yet unknown circumstance, the vital
principle has its action suspended, but neither its existence
destroyed, nor its organs injured, so as absolutely
to prevent recovery, if not too long neglected.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE VITAL PRINCIPLE SUSPENDED.</div>

<p>Dr. Franz Hartmann reports a case which occurred
within half a mile of his residence near Hallein,
Austria:&mdash;“At Oberalm, near Hallein, there died the
widow of a Dr. Ettenberger, a lawyer. It was known
that she had previously been affected with fits of catalepsy,
and therefore all possible means were taken for
the purpose of restoring her to life. All, however, were
in vain, and her death appeared to be certain. On the
third day, just before the hour appointed for the funeral,
the family physician, Dr. Leber, bethought himself of
trying some fresh experiments on the corpse, when the
woman revived. She had been fully conscious all the
time, and aware of all the preparations that were made
for her funeral, although unable to make it known to
others that she was still alive.”</p>

<p>Dr. Hartmann says:&mdash;“In 1866, in Kronstadt, a
young and strong man, Orrendo by name, had a fit and
died. He was put into a coffin and deposited in the
family vault in a church. Fourteen years afterwards, in
1880, the same vault was opened again for the purpose
of admitting another corpse. A horrible sight met
those who entered. Orrendo’s coffin was empty, and
his skeleton lying upon the floor. But the rest of the
coffins were also broken open and emptied of their
contents. It seemed to show that the man after
awakening had burst his coffin open, and, becoming
insane, had smashed the others, after which he had been
starved to death.”&mdash;<i>Premature Burial</i>, <i>p.</i> 7.</p>

<p>Bouchut, in “Signes de la Mort,” p. 40, relates that
“A lawyer at Vesoul was subject to fits of fainting, but
kept the matter secret, so that the knowledge of it
might not spread and interfere with his prospects of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
marriage; he only spoke confidentially of it to one of
his friends. The marriage took place, and he lived for
some time in good health, then suddenly fell into one
of his fits, and his wife and the doctors, believing him
dead, had him placed in a coffin, and got everything
ready for the funeral. His friend was absent, but fortunately
returned just in time to prevent the burial. The
lawyer recovered, and lived for sixteen years after this
event.”</p>

<p class="psh">INTENSE COLD.</p>

<div class="sidenote">EFFECTS OF INTENSE COLD.</div>

<p>M. Charles Londe, in “La Mort Apparente,” p. 16,
says:&mdash;“Intense cold, coincident with privations and
fatigue, will produce all the phenomena of apparent
death&mdash;phenomena susceptible of prolongation during
several days without producing actual death, and consequently
exposing the individual who could be restored
to life to living burial;” and he further maintains it as
an indisputable fact that every day people are thus
interred alive.</p>

<p>Struve, in his essay on “Suspended Animation,” p. 140,
says:&mdash;“In no case whatever is the danger of committing
homicide greater than in the treatment of persons
who have suffered by severe cold. Their death-like
state may deceive our judgment, not only because such
persons continue longest apparently dead, but because
the want of susceptibility of irritation is in many cases
not distinguishable from real death. A man benumbed
with cold burnt his feet, and had continued insensible to
pain, nor did he feel this sensation till he warmed them
at a fire. In this case it is evident that the susceptibility
of irritation was destroyed, while vital power
remained.”</p>

<p class="psh">INFLUENZA.</p>

<p>This is a malady that has been enormously rife all
over the world during the past few years, and has baffled
the efforts of physicians and sanitarians to arrest its
progress: it is sometimes accompanied by conditions
which can hardly be distinguished from catalepsy.</p>

<p>The <i>Lancet</i>, May 31, 1890, page 1215, gives the
following:&mdash;</p>


<div class="pbq">

<p class="pc1">“CATALEPSY AS A SEQUELA OF INFLUENZA.</p>

<p>“The neurotic sequelæ of influenza seem engaging
more attention abroad than at home, probably from their
symptoms being more pronounced than on this side the
Channel. ‘Nonna,’ as it is called, if something more than
the somnolence succeeding the exhaustion of influenza,
has been thought in Upper Italy to have much in
common with catalepsy&mdash;one case, indeed, amounting
to the ‘apparent death’ of Pacini. This is reported
from Como. The patient, Pasquale Ossola by name,
had to all appearance died, and a certificate to that
effect, after due consultation, was drawn up and signed.
Already it wanted but an hour or so to the interment,
when the ‘corpse’ began to move spontaneously and to
exhibit signs of returning life. The relatives of the
supposed dead man at once called in assistance, and
though animation and consciousness, even to recognition,
were restored, the resuscitation was not maintained,
and the patient died. Fortunately, the funeral
had been arranged on the traditional lines, and the
faint chance of return to life was not extinguished by
cremation.”</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>


<p class="psh">NARCOTICS.</p>

<p>Referring to the supposed death of a girl, Sarola,
aged eleven years, to whom chloroform had been
administered in September, 1894, under peculiar circumstances,
and the body hurried off to cremation, Dr.
Roger S. Chew, of Calcutta, writes:&mdash;“That bottle of
medicine was charged with having caused the death
of little Sarola, who, I firmly believe, was <i>burned
alive</i> while in a cataleptic condition induced by the
hysterical convulsions, and rendered profound by the
administration of the chloroform.<span class="sidenote">CHLOROFORM DEATHS PREVENTABLE.</span> Surgeon Lieutenant-Colonel
Edward Lawrie agrees with me that at least
ninety per cent. of the chloroform deaths are preventable
if proper measures are adopted to resuscitate the
body, and it is quite possible for a chloroform narcotic
to be launched into eternity on the funeral pyre or in
the suffocating earth. What a mournful vista Sarola’s
case opens up, and who can say how many hundreds
have been similarly disposed of!”&mdash;<i>Communicated to the
Author.</i></p>

<p>Sir Benjamin Ward Richardson, in “The Absolute
Signs and Proofs of Death,” in the <i>Asclepiad</i>, first quarter,
1889, p. 9, says:&mdash;“In the first experiments made
in this country with chloral, after the discovery of its
effects by Liebriech, we learned that such a deep narcotism
could be induced by this narcotic that it might
be impossible to say whether an animal under its influence
were alive or dead.” And referring to cataleptic
trance due to shock, he observes, p. 11, “True traumatic
catalepsy is equally remarkable, and equally embarrassing.
It has been witnessed in the most destructive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
form after shock by lightning, and it may also have
been met with after severe blows and contusions of
the head.”</p>


<p class="psh">CHOLERA.</p>

<p>Dr. Chew, referring to another of the predisposing
causes of apparent death, and the danger of premature
burial in India, says:&mdash;“In the cholera season there is
a risk of a soldier being buried alive, as the custom is
to get rid of the body as soon as possible, and it is
very seldom indeed that a <i>post-mortem</i> is held on a
cholera corpse. If the case be one of <i>true</i> cholera, decomposition
sets in before the breath has entirely left
the body, and, immediately life is extinct, putrefaction
rushes forward so rapidly as to render a mistake impossible;
but in choleraic diarrhœa or the lighter forms
of cholera it is possible that coma resultant on extreme
collapse may suspend animation so as to simulate real
death <i>without</i> actual cessation of vital energy, and lead
to live sepulture, except where, by some such lucky
accident as the burial ground being a long journey off,
the funeral is delayed sufficiently to give a chance of
recovery. And this same accident may prove a salvation
in syncope or coma from shock or protracted
illness.</p>

<p>“With the civil population, save in very exceptional
cases, there is very little chance of recovery from apparent
death, as the time between alleged decease and
sepulture is very short indeed; and unless there are
unmistakable signs of trance, syncope, or coma, the
victim must die <i>after he</i> (or she) <i>has been buried
alive</i>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p class="psh">VARIOUS PREDISPOSING DISEASES.</p>

<p>Living burials take place because the general public
are ignorant of the fact that there are many (some
thirty) diseases, and some states of the body that cannot
be called diseases, as well as a number of incidents and
accidents, which produce all the appearances of death
so closely as to deceive any one.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THEIR NUMBER AND VARIETY.</div>

<p>Excessive joy or excessive grief will often paralyse
the nervous system, including the action of the heart
and the respiratory functions, and occasion the appearance
of sudden death as well as shocks, blows upon
the head, fright, strokes of lightning, violent displays of
temper; also certain drugs now in common medical
use, such as Indian hemp, atropia, digitalis, tobacco,
morphia, and veratrum. According to Dr. Léonce Lénormand,
in “Des Inhumations Précipitées,” pp. 85-104, the
following diseases and conditions not infrequently produce
the like symptoms, viz., apoplexy, asphyxia, catalepsy,
epilepsy, nervous exhaustion, ecstasy, hæmorrhage,
hysteria, lethargy, syncope, tetanus, etc.</p>

<p>Dr. Herbert Mayo in his “Letters on Truths contained
in Popular Superstitions,” p. 34, remarks “that
death-trance belongs to diseases of the nervous system,
but in any form of disease, when the body is brought
to a certain state of debility, death-trance may
supervene.”</p>

<p>Dr. Hartmann observes: “The cases in which persons
apparently dead have been restored to health by appropriate
means are innumerable, and such accounts may
be added to without end, as they are of daily occurrence,
while it is also self-evident that, if they had not thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
been saved, premature burial and death in the coffin
would have taken place. But it also often happens that
cases of apparent death recover spontaneously, and even
after all possible means taken for the restoration of life
have failed. This is specially the case in catalepsy, due
to nervous exhaustion, which requires no other remedy
than sufficient rest for the recuperation of the life-power,
which no kind of medicine can supply.”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<p class="pch">PREMATURE BURIAL AND CREMATION IN INDIA.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> following are some of the facts and experiences
which were brought to the author’s notice during a visit
to India in the early part of 1896.</p>

<p class="psh">THE CALCUTTA BURNING GHAT.</p>

<p>On February 9, 1896, I visited the Burning Ghat on
the banks of the Ganges, Calcutta, where twenty bodies
are reduced to ashes by fire daily. The corpse of an
aged Hindu woman had just been brought in on my
arrival, death, we were told, having occurred but an
hour before. The deputy registrar asked the nearest
relative a few questions as to the age, caste, next of
kin, cause of death, which were duly recorded in a book
kept for that purpose, and, the charges having been paid,
the body, which was as supple as in life (and, except for
want of volition, bore no visible marks of death), was
placed upon the logs, which were alternately crossed over
each other, other logs being placed on the top of the
body, with straw underneath. The family being poor in
this case, no expensive spiced oils, ghee, or sandal wood
were used. The pyre having been sprinkled with water
from the sacred river, the nearest male relative took a
wisp of lighted straw and ran seven times round it,
shouting “Ram, Ram, sach hai” (the god Ram is true
and great indeed). He then applied the torch, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
in a few seconds reached the body, while a Hindu priest
recited verses from the Vedas. The process of burning
occupied about four hours. Two other bodies, one an
adult, and the other a child, were nearly burnt to ashes
during my visit. It appears that in India, when the
body is motionless, and assumes a death-like appearance,
as in trance or catalepsy, no attempt is ever made
at resuscitation, no matter how suddenly or unexpectedly
the supposed death may occur, nor is there any proper
method of examination for the purpose of death certification.
Amongst the Hindus death is not considered
an evil, but is the gate leading to a better and happier
world. Many Hindus when ill are carried by their
friends to the banks of the sacred Ganges, where they
meet death with much hope, and without fear.</p>

<p>At the General Hospital, Colombo, I was told by Dr.
Van Lagenberg that there was absolutely no protection
against premature burials for persons subject to trance,
as, although according to the law medical certification
was obligatory, medical examination was not; the
doctor taking the word of the friends as to the fact of
death, and certifying accordingly. Early burial (about
six hours after death) was the rule. The Mother
Superior to the staff of nurses mentioned the case of
the venerable Father Vestarani, an aged Catholic priest
of Colombo, who was subject to attacks of epilepsy:
these were followed by apparent death, and he had
several narrow escapes from premature burial. This
case was also known to my friend, Mr. Peter de Abrew,
of Colombo, and others. The house surgeon, Dr. H. M.
Fernando, said that amongst the Moslems burial followed
apparent death very quickly, sometimes in an hour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>From Mr. Vira Raghava Chri, of Madras, manager of
the <i>Hindu</i>, I learned that the Brahmins always burn the
dead soon after death occurs. The relatives, if they reside
within easy reach, are sent for. The body is washed in
cold water, and after two or three hours the religious
service begins, which is performed by the priests, and
consists of citations from the Vedas having reference
to the departure of the soul from the body, and to the
lessons the solemn event teaches. These ceremonies
generally last for two or three hours, after which the body
is taken to be burned. In answer to my inquiries as
to what would happen if within that time no sign of
decomposition was exhibited, Mr. Chri informed me
that under no circumstances would they wait for more
than six hours before the body was taken to be burned.
He had heard of cases of persons declared to be dead
coming to life while being carried to the funeral pyre,
when they were restored to and welcomed by their
friends. Cases were also known of the corpse sitting
up amidst the flames, and being beaten down by those
in charge of the funeral. They were believed to be the
victims of premature cremation. He thought, however,
that such cases were rare amongst his co-religionists.</p>

<p>Mr. Mohan Chunder Roy, M.B., of Benares, said that
it was a very difficult matter, even for a medical practitioner,
to distinguish the living from the dead,<span class="sidenote">DIFFICULTY OF DIAGNOSIS.</span> and,
where there were no signs of putrefaction, it was his
custom to advise the relatives to wait before burial, or
before sending the body to the burning ghat, which they
were very reluctant to do. When apparent revivals to
consciousness occurred on the pyre, the superstitious
people believed that it was due to the presence of evil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
spirits, and the attempt to escape is frustrated by
cremators in charge of the burning ghat. This barbarous
custom has been repeatedly affirmed to me by
intelligent natives as a matter of common notoriety.</p>

<p>One reason why Hindus are hurried to the cremation
ground so quickly, and without waiting to see whether
the case is one of trance or suspended animation, is that
the relatives are not allowed either to eat or drink while
the body remains in the house. If a person touches
any article in the house of mourning, that article must
be washed and purified. After the cremation all the
relatives purify themselves by bathing before they are
allowed to eat or drink.</p>

<p>Mr. Durga Prasad, editor of the <i>Harbinger</i>, Lahore,
writes, February 29, 1896:&mdash;“I recollect, when about
twelve years old, my grandmother, who was held in
great esteem for her piety and experience, told me that
she was once declared to be dead, and was therefore
carried to our crematorium, or burning-place; but when
about to be burnt she came back to life.”</p>

<p>Mr. Joseph, assistant secretary at the Public Library
and Museum, Colombo, told the author that his father,
owing to weakness of the heart, was subject to frequent
attacks of trance-like insensibility. They passed away
by simple treatment in a few hours, but were sometimes
quite alarming. He was afraid, owing to the superstitious
fear of death among the ignorant classes in
Ceylon, and the terror which keeping a corpse, or a
person in a state of catalepsy, where volition had ceased,
excited, that many were buried or burned alive, as it
was the custom, particularly amongst the Mahomedans,
to carry the body away a few hours after death. Signs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
of decomposition quickly appeared in a tropical climate,
but this unequivocal mode of verifying death was not
often waited for by Moslems.</p>

<p class="psh">SRI SUMANGALA ON SINHALESE BURIALS IN
CEYLON.</p>

<p>Sri Sumangala, the venerable High Priest of the
Buddhists of Ceylon, and Principal of the College for
Buddhist Priests, at an interview the author had with
him in January, 1895, stated that among the Sinhalese
the chances of burial or cremation of the apparently dead
are not frequent.<span class="sidenote">BURIAL IN CEYLON.</span> Their customs are such that a corpse
is seldom or never removed for burial or cremation
before the expiry of twenty-four hours after death is
said to have taken place. During that time climatic
influence renders signs of decomposition and putrefaction
apparent.</p>

<p>Only one case came under the observation of the venerable
theologian, which was that of a person bitten by
a cobra. The man apparently succumbed, but a native
specialist, having arrived at the cemetery just before
the burial, examined the case, and said that life was
<i>not extinct</i>, and saved the man from a premature
grave.</p>

<p>The following is from the <i>British Medical Journal</i>,
April 26, 1884, p. 844:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="pc1">“PREMATURE INTERMENT.</p>

<p>“The <i>Times of India</i>, for March 21, has the following story:&mdash;On
last Friday morning the family of a Goanese, named Manuel,
aged seventy years, who had been for the last four months suffering
from dysentery, thinking that he was dead, made preparations
for his funeral. He was placed in a coffin and taken from his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
house, at Worlee, to a chapel at Lower Mahim, preparatory
to burial. The priest, on putting his hand on the man’s chest,
found his heart still beating. He was thereupon removed to the
Jamsetjee Jejeebhoy Hospital, where he remained in an unconscious
state up to a late hour on last Friday night, when he died.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">In a communication to the author from Mr. Nasarvariji
F. Billimoria, dated March 14, 1896, the writer
says that, where cases of premature burning have
occurred in India, the relatives are unwilling to have
the facts published, and shrink from making them
known. Moreover, when members of a family once
declared dead have been rejected by their friends in the
land of shadows, and have returned to this life, they
are believed to bring misfortune with them, and discredit
is attached to the families in consequence. Mr.
Billimoria says the following cases can be relied upon
as authentic:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“In the year 18&mdash;, in the town of B&mdash;&mdash;, a Marwari was taken
as dead and carried to the cremation ground. Unfortunately, at
that time a superstition was prevalent among all classes of
Indians that, if a dead one is brought back to his or her house, a
plague would break out in the town. When, therefore, the
Marwari survived, instead of bringing him back to the house, or
even allowing him to roam elsewhere, he was killed, it is said, by
a hatchet, which they were in the habit of carrying with them to
break the fuel for the funeral pyre. This had happened in the old
Gaekwari days when Governments did not interfere in the superstitious
customs of the people.”</p>

<p class="p1">Fortunately, however, those days are gone, and with
them the old superstitions. Some time ago a fisherwoman,
after taking a liberal dose of alcoholic drink
and opium, was found (apparently) dead by her relatives&mdash;low-caste
Hindus. No time is lost among the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
Hindus, high or low caste, to remove the body to the
cremation ground after a man is found dead.</p>

<div class="pbq">
<p class="p1">“A bamboo bier was being prepared to carry the fisherwoman
to the <i>Samashân</i> (cremation ground), upon which the body was
laid as usual, and the relatives were to lift it to their shoulders:
when, lo! the woman turned herself on the bier on her side, and,
thanks to the good sense of the fishermen, she is still enjoying her
life while I am writing.</p>

<div class="sidenote1">HASTY CREMATION.</div>

<p>“A young daughter of a Bania was sick for a long time, and was
found apparently dead by her relatives, and carried to the <i>Samashân</i>.
These grounds are generally situated at a river side.
When the bier was prepared for certain ceremonies, the girl
showed signs of revival, and, one by one, the relatives would go
near the bier, bend down, stare at the face, and retire aghast.
Information had reached the town that the girl had survived; but
the body, nevertheless, was cremated, and never brought back
to the house. It is believed that in this case, although the girl
had revived for a little time, she had died soon afterwards, as she
had been ill for a long time previously. Granting that it was a
case in which the dying became actively conscious a few minutes
before real death, it is certain that great and indecent haste was
practised by the relatives in pressing on the cremation, as is the
usual mode in India.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">The <i>Bombay Guardian</i>, January 11, 1896, under the
head of “The Week’s News,” announced that&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“A Brahmin went to Poona to attend the National Congress.
He was laid up with fever, became dangerously ill, and fell into
a trance. His friends, thinking him dead, made the necessary
arrangements for the funeral. They took the supposed dead man
to the river to be burned, but, just as the funeral procession
arrived near the Shane temple, his head and hands were seen
moving. The cloth having been removed from his face, he opened
his eyes and tried to speak. He was taken home.”</p>

<p class="p1">This case was reported also in the <i>Times of India</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>The subject of hasty and premature burials in India
might with much profit be introduced at the National
Congress. The author believes that thousands of people
are annually buried and burned in a state of suspended
animation&mdash;particularly in places where cholera, small-pox,
and other devastating plagues prevail. It is usual,
both amongst the Parsees and the Hindus, to begin
preparations for the religious ceremonies when the case
is considered hopeless.</p>

<p>Dr. Roger S. Chew, of Calcutta, who for some years
occupied the position of army surgeon in India, writes
to me:&mdash;“Though there is every risk of live interment
with those classes who bury their dead, this is a risk
(save in cases of epidemic or battlefield) the British
soldier never runs in India, where the military law
requires that a <i>post-mortem</i> examination, not earlier than
twelve hours after decease, must be held on every soldier
who dies from any cause except a highly contagious
or infectious disease.” In the present unsatisfactory
state of the law might not this safeguard be generally
adopted?</p>

<p class="psh">THE TOWERS OF SILENCE, BOMBAY.</p>

<p>On Sunday, March 15, 1896, my daughter and I
were accompanied to the Towers of Silence, situated on
the highest part of Malabar Hill, Bombay, by Mr. Phiroze
C. Sethna, a highly accomplished Parsee merchant, to
whom we were indebted for many acts of kindness
during our sojourn in the city. The position is one
of rare beauty, commanding as it does charming
panoramic views of Bombay and the surrounding neighbourhood,
while immediately below are extensive cocoa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
and other tropical plantations. At the entrance to the
towers is a notice-board in English, stating that none
but Parsees are admitted. We passed under the porch
into the sacred enclosure, and found ourselves in the
midst of a lovely garden planted with choice shrubs
and trees, and were each presented by the gardener
with bouquets of freshly-cut flowers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE TOWERS OF SILENCE.</div>

<p>The towers are five in number, the smallest having
been erected in 1669, all modelled after the same pattern,
and are about twenty-five feet high. Inside is
a circular platform about three hundred feet in circumference
paved with large slabs, and divided into rows
of shallow open receptacles in which the bodies are
placed. There are three sections&mdash;for males, females,
and children. We noticed a number of vultures sitting
on the adjacent trees, and were informed that, when a
funeral is on its way, large numbers congregate upon
the coping of the tower, ready to seize the body and
devour it the moment it is deposited by the corpse-bearers
on the slabs, after the conclusion of the funeral
ceremonies. In an hour or less the corpse is completely
stripped of its flesh, when the bones are thrown into a
well. From a sanitary point of view, the plan is preferable
to burying or to cremation, which last, as it is
carried out in India, is a slow and tedious process.
Vultures have never been known to attack children, or
even babies left by their mothers tied for safety to a
branch of a tree, and will not, it is said, attack a person
only apparently dead, as in a trance or coma.</p>

<p>Another custom amongst the Parsees in the treatment
of their dead is to bring a dog to the corpse before it is
removed from the house, and another dog on its arrival<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
at the Tower of Silence. This ceremony is known as the
Sagdeed. In a pamphlet on the “Funeral Ceremonies of
the Parsees,” by Ervad Jivanji Jamshedje Mody, B.A.,
a learned priest of the Parsee cult, with whom the
author had the pleasure of an interview, the explanation
is that, according to the ancient belief, the spotted dog
can discriminate between the really and the apparently
dead. Dr. Franz Hartmann and other writers appear
also to be of the opinion, which the author considers
highly probable, that a dog knows whether his master
is really dead or only in a trance; but that a strange
dog would be able to discriminate and act as a sentinel
to prevent a living person being mistaken for a dead
one, is highly improbable.</p>

<p>Having heard of several cases of persons taken to the
Towers of Silence who recovered consciousness after
being laid within the enclosure, I asked Mr. Jivanji
Mody what would happen in such a case, and what
means of escape there would be? Mr. Mody replied
that within the tower there is a chain hanging from the
coping to the floor, by which a person could draw himself
up to the top of the structure, and he would then be
seen and rescued. In a neatly-constructed model of
these towers at the museum, Victoria Gardens, Bombay,
no chain is visible. The subject of apparent death, or
suspended animation, and how to prevent premature
burial, premature cremation, and premature exposure
in the Towers of Silence, is beginning to excite interest
in some parts of India. Mr. Ardeshar Nowroji, Fort
Bombay, student of Zoroastrian literature, is to read
a paper on the subject before the Debating Society
at Elphinstone College. Mr. Soabjee Dhunjeebhoy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
Wadia is also studying literature bearing on the same
topic.</p>

<p>Mr. Dadabhoy Nusserwanje, a Bombay Parsee and
merchant, residing at Colombo, Ceylon, informed the
author, January 28, 1896, that he knew of two cases
where his co-religionists had been declared dead, and
the bodies prepared for burial (the preparation including
the long religious service as prescribed by their
formulas), who were only in a trance. This was proved
by their having come back to life when placed in the
Towers of Silence in Bombay. It appears that any
persons officially and religiously given over for dead were
formerly not allowed to be restored to their relatives,
or to the society to which they belonged, as they were
supposed to carry with them, from their dead associates,
liability to plagues or ill luck, and they are consequently
obliged to migrate to distant parts of the country.
My informant said that this superstition was so deeply
rooted in the minds of the Parsee people that he did
not think a reform was possible.</p>

<p>Cases of persons in a trance, mistaken for dead, are
by no means uncommon, as would appear from the
following communication from Mr. Nasarvariji F. Billimoria,
a Parsee of Bombay, addressed to Dr. Franz
Hartmann, and not previously published:-</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“Several cases of revival of the apparently dead among the
Parsees,” writes Mr. Billimoria, “have come to my notice.</p>

<p>“A Parsee, whom I shall call M&mdash;&mdash; B&mdash;&mdash;, was given up as
dead. The body was laid on the ground, and the usual ceremonies
were being performed, when, to the surprise of the people surrounding
the body, he rose and described some spiritual experience.
He died long after this event took place, at a good old age,
at Bilimora, a town about eighty miles north of Bombay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>“S&mdash;&mdash;, a girl of about ten years, was also taken as dead in the
same town, and, after laying her body on the ground, prayers were
being recited by the priests. She rose and said that she had been
to some other land, where she saw an old lady who ordered her
to go away, as she was not required there just then. She died at
a good old age a few months ago.</p>

<p>“A woman in the garb of a Hindu beggar was some time ago in
the habit of interviewing Parsee ladies at odd times, viz., at
about three or four o’clock in the morning, at the same place, and
asking several questions pertaining to religion. It was afterwards
found that she was K&mdash;&mdash; (widow of a Parsee priest), who had
apparently died a short time before, and, after revival, had emerged
from the Tower of Silence, and, a superstition being prevalent
among the people that none should be taken back among us who
return from the dead, she dared not unite with the Parsees, and
hence led a wanderer’s life.</p>

<p>“In Bombay, too, I have heard of some cases of the revival of
the apparently dead among the Parsees, the principal of them
being a lady of a wealthy family, and a Parsee who afterwards
carried on his profession as a physician. The physician was living
as a Christian on account of the prejudice among the Parsees
before referred to. He was called “Mûtchala Dâktar,” <i>i.e.</i>,
doctor with big moustache.</p>

<p>“Similar cases had also occurred in Surat, where two Parsee
women had returned from the Towers of Silence, one of whom
lived afterwards as a Sanyasini. What became of the other I
cannot say.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">“The funeral ceremonies among the Parsees provide
that, after the signs of death are manifest, the body be
washed with warm water, and laid on a clean sheet;
two persons hold the hands of the dead person, joining
themselves by a <i>paivand</i> of tape. The priests recite
certain prayers, after which the body is laid on ground
set apart for the purpose in the house. Here it lies for
several hours, during which time priests recite alternately
certain prayers, while a fire is kept alive with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
fragrant combustibles near the body. The Nasasâlârs,
or corpse-bearers, arrive at the appointed time, when
the fire is taken away, and other manthrâ or prayers,
which occupy an hour or so, are recited by two priests
conjointly, gazing first on the iron bier, and then on
the face of the body. A procession is then formed,
and the body is carried by the Nasasâlârs only, the
others walking in pairs, joining themselves by holding
a handkerchief in their hands, several yards distant from
the body. The Towers of Silence are removed from
the habitations of mankind, sometimes, miles distant,
where, after the arrival of the funeral procession, the
last obeisance is performed, and the body is carried into
the tower, which is called <i>Dukhmâh</i>, the mourners,
except the Nasasâlârs, remaining outside. The procession
returns after further prayers. The towers are
entirely open from above to allow ample sunlight, and
to allow the carrion-birds access to the dead.</p>

<p>“From the foregoing it would appear that, with
regard to the disposal of the dead, the Parsee system
offers advantages, in respect of the revival of the supposed
dead persons, over the European system of burial.
After real or supposed death, a fire is kept burning near
the body, the heat of which would indirectly assist in
resuscitating those in a state of suspended animation.</p>

<p>“If a man dies in the afternoon, his body is not carried
to the towers till next day, and in that case the fire is kept
alive the whole night near the body, two priests alternately
reciting manthrâs. Some time is thus allowed to
intervene between the supposed death and the disposal
of the body in the Towers of Silence. There, too, the
body is not laid without Zoroastrian ceremony. But in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
the system of disposal itself we see another protection,
in that the carrion-birds do not touch the body unless
they instinctively find evidence of putrefaction. It is a
fact that in not a few cases persons have escaped from
the dismal and terrible fate of being laid alive in the
Towers of Silence. The system of disposal in the tower
may appear to non-Zoroastrians repulsive; but neither
the system of cremation nor burial will give us back
those whom they have once devoured. That the Parsees
do not allow those who have returned from the Towers
of Silence to intermingle among them is another question.
This too, however, has attracted the attention
of this small community; and I hear that there is a
standing order issued from the trustees of the Parsee
Panchayet at Bombay to the Nasasâlârs (the corpse-bearers)
to the effect that they would be rewarded if they
would give information or bring back any body which
had been revived after it had been carried to the Towers
of Silence.”</p>

<p>The Parsee custom of using the dog is suggestive.
There are numerous cases on record where a dog,
following his master to the grave as one of the
mourners, has refused to leave the grave; and these
have been quoted as a proof of the undying love of
the master’s canine friend. May it not be that dogs
are gifted, as believed by the Parsees, with another sense
denied to most men&mdash;the faculty of discerning between
real and apparent death? A medical correspondent
relates the following:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“In Austria, in 1870, a man seemed to be dead, and was
placed in a coffin. After the usual three days of watching over
the supposed corpse, the funeral was commenced; and when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
coffin was being carried out of the house, it was noticed that the
dog which belonged to the supposed defunct became very cross,
and manifested great eagerness toward the coffin, and could not
be driven away. Finally, as the coffin was about to be placed in
the hearse, the dog attacked the bearers so furiously that they
dropped it on the ground; and in the shock the lid was broken
off, and the man inside awoke from his lethargic condition, and
soon recovered his full consciousness. He was alive and well at
last news of him. Dogs might possibly be of use in deciding
doubtful cases, where their master was concerned.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">Also the following:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<div class="sidenote1">INTELLIGENCE OF DOGS.</div>

<p class="p1">“The postmaster of a village in Moravia ‘died’ in a fit of
epilepsy, and was buried three days afterwards in due form. He
had a little pet dog which showed great affection towards him, and
after the burial the dog remained upon the man’s grave and
howled dismally, and would not be driven away. Several times
the dog was taken home forcibly, but whenever it could escape it
immediately returned. This lasted for a week, and became the
talk of the village. About a year afterwards that part of the
grave-yard had to be removed owing to an enlargement in building
the church, and consequently the grave of the postmaster was
opened, and the body was found in such a state and position as
to leave no doubt that he had been buried alive, had returned to
consciousness, and had died in the grave. The physician who
had signed the certificate of death went insane on that account,
soon after the discovery was made.”&mdash;<i>Premature Burial, p. 109,

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER X.</h2>

<p class="pch">THE DANGER OF HASTY BURIALS.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Early</span> burials are advocated and defended by certain
writers on sanitary grounds; and there is, no doubt,
something to be said for them, provided the body
shows unmistakable signs of dissolution; but to impose
a general rule upon Englishmen by Parliament,
or upon Americans by State Legislature, as has been
urged, would add to the existing evil of perfunctory and
mistaken diagnosis of death, and greatly increase the
number of premature interments. The Romans kept
the bodies of the dead a week before burial, lest
through haste they should inter them while life remained.
Servius, in his commentary on Virgil, tells
us&mdash;“That on the eighth day they burned the body,
and on the ninth put its ashes in the grave.” Plato
enjoined the bodies of the dead to be kept until the
third day, <i>in order</i> (as he says) <i>to be satisfied of the
reality of the death</i>. Quintilian explains why the
Romans delayed burials as follows:&mdash;“For what purpose
do ye imagine that long-delayed interments were
invented? Or on what account is it that the mournful
pomp of funeral solemnities is always interrupted by
sorrowful groans and piercing cries? Why, for no
other reason, but because we have seen persons return
to life after they were about to be laid in the grave as
dead.” “For this reason,” adds Lancisi, in “De Subita.
Mort.,” lib. i., cap. 15, “the Legislature has wisely and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
prudently prohibited the immediate, or the too speedy,
interment of all dead persons, and especially of such as
have the misfortune to be cut off by a sudden death.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE ADVANTAGE OF DELAY.</div>

<p>Terilli, a celebrated physician of Venice, in a treatise
of the “Causes of Sudden Death,” sect. vi., cap. 2,
says:&mdash;“Since the body is sometimes so deprived of
every vital function, and the principle of life reduced so
low, that it cannot be distinguished from death, the laws
both of natural comparison and revealed religion oblige
us to wait a sufficient time for life manifesting itself by
the usual signs, peradventure it should not be, as yet,
totally extinguished; and if we should act a contrary
part, we may possibly become murderers, by confining
to the gloomy regions of the dead those who are actually
alive.”</p>

<p>Mr. Cooper, surgeon, in his treatise on “The Uncertainty
of the Signs of Death,” pp. 70, 71, had in his
possession the following certificate, written and signed
by Mr. Blau, a native of Auvergne, a man of untainted
veracity:&mdash;“I hereto subscribe, and declare, that fifty-five
years ago, happening to reside at Toulouse for the
sake of my studies, and going to St. Stephen’s Church
to hear a sermon, I saw a corpse brought thither for the
sake of interment. The ceremony, however, was delayed
till the sermon should be over; but the supposed dead
person, being laid in a chapel and attended by all the
mourners, about the middle of the sermon discovered
manifest signs of life, for which reason he was quickly
conveyed back to his own house. From a consideration
of circumstances, it is sufficiently obvious that, without
the intervention of the sermon, the man had been
interred alive.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>Between 1780 and 1800 many pamphlets on the
subject appeared in Germany and France. Opposite
sides were taken, some advocating delay until putrefaction,
others urging immediate burial.</p>

<p>In 1788, Marcus Hertz wrote strongly against the
prevailing precipitate burials among the Jews. He
asked “what motive could justify hasty burials;” and
continued:&mdash;“The writings of learned men and doctors,
of both early times and recent date, describe the dangers
of precipitate burial; there is not a town in the world
that has not its stories of revivals in the grave.”</p>

<p>In 1791, Rev. J. W. C. Wolff, in Germany, published
numerous narratives of narrow escapes from the grave.</p>

<p>In 1792, Rev. Johann Moritz Schwager stated that
he had preached for twenty years against precipitate
burials, and that he had been requested to do so by
a number of corporate bodies who had evidence of the
danger of hasty interments.</p>

<p>About 1800 great excitement prevailed in Germany
on account of some narrow escapes from living burial
that happened in high quarters, many books and pamphlets
having been issued, and sermons preached by the
clergy on the subject. The key-note of all of these was
the fallaciousness of the appearances of death, and that
none was reliable but decomposition.</p>

<p>About this period Dr. Herachborg, of Königsberg,
Prussia, wrote that, for forty years, as a doctor, he had
always been disgusted with the practice of hasty
burials; and, to show the ignorance of the times, he
mentions the case of a woman he kept under observation
in bed for three days, when her relations took her out
and placed her on the floor, insisting that she was dead.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
He resisted her burial, and had her covered with
blankets; so that by being kept warm she recovered
completely. He insisted that no sign of death could
be relied upon.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HASTY BURIAL IN TURKEY.</div>

<p>From the <i>British Medical Journal</i>, April 12, 1862,
p. 390. “The <i>Gaz. Méd. d’Orient</i> tells us that people
in Constantinople are, in all probability, not unfrequently
buried alive, in consequence of the precipitancy with
which their burial is performed. If the person dies
during the night, he has some chance of escaping premature
sepulture; but if he dies during the day, he is sure
to be in his tomb in two hours after he has drawn his
last breath. Facts of daily occurrence in this country,
we are told, prove that persons who were thought to
have died during the night have recovered before
morning, and thus, thanks to the intervention of night,
have been saved from being interred alive. Other facts
of not unfrequent occurrence show that persons have
recovered while on their road to the grave. In other
rarer cases, again, the cries of the revivified half-buried
ones have been heard by the passers-by, and thus saved
from a horrible conclusion.”</p>

<p>In all countries it is the custom amongst the Jews to
bury their dead, and apparently dead, quickly, without
taking the slightest steps for restoration, and many are
the catastrophes recorded.</p>

<p>“The Report of the Royal Humane Society” of 1802
states:&mdash;“At the funeral of a Jewess, one of the bearers
thought he heard repeatedly some motion in the coffin,
and informed his friends. Medical assistance being
obtained, she returned to her home in a few hours completely
restored.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>From the <i>British Medical Journal</i>, March 8, 1879,
p. 356.</p>

<p class="psh">“SUSPENDED ANIMATION.</p>

<p>“A Jew, aged seventy, who had been ailing for some
time, apparently died recently in Lemberg, on a Friday
night, after severe convulsions. The deceased having
been legally certified, the body was put on a bier,
preparatory to the funeral, which had to be deferred,
the next day being the Jewish Sabbath. Two pious
brethren who had, according to their custom, been
spending the night in prayer, watching the dead, were
suddenly, on the morning of the Saturday, disturbed
from their devotions by strange sounds proceeding from
the bier, and, to their dismay, saw the dead man slowly
rising, and preparing to descend from it, using at the
same time very strong language. Both brethren fled
very precipitately; and one of them has since died from
the effects of the fright. It is hoped by the <i>Wiener
Medicinische Zeitung</i> that this case will make the local
government watch the Jewish funerals more carefully,
as it is known that the Jews often bury their dead very
quickly.”</p>

<p>The <i>Undertakers’ Journal</i>, January 22, 1887, says:&mdash;“The
dangers that may arise from premature interment
are illustrated by a sensational incident which recently
occurred at Trencsin, in Hungary. The wife of the
Rabbi of the Jewish Congregation apparently died
suddenly without having been previously ill. The
night before the funeral the female watcher, sitting in
an adjoining room, heard a noise in the chamber of
death, and, when, stricken with horror, she ventured to
open the door, she found that the seemingly dead woman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
had risen from her bier, and had thrown off the shroud
by which she was covered. By a fortunate accident the
interment had been postponed in consequence of the
intervening Sabbath, otherwise a horrible fate would
have overtaken the Rabbi’s wife.”</p>

<p>The <i>Lancet</i>, August 23, 1884, vol. ii., p. 329, comments
thus:&mdash;</p>

<p class="psh">“BURYING CHOLERA PATIENTS ALIVE.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE LANCET’S SUGGESTIONS.</div>

<p>“It is not so much undue haste as inexcusable carelessness
that must be blamed for the premature burying
of persons who are not really dead. Such heedlessness
as alone can lead to the commission of this crime is
not a shade less black than manslaughter. We speak
strongly, because this is a matter in regard to which
measures ought to be at once taken to render the
horrible act impossible, and to dismiss all fear from the
public mind. If it be a fact, as would seem to be indisputable,
that during the last few weeks there have been
cases&mdash;we will not attempt to say how many or how
few&mdash;of burying alive, a scandal and a horror, wholly
unpardonable in the last quarter of the nineteenth century,
have to be faced; and the sooner the full truth is
known and rules of safety established the better. Let
it be once for all decided that measures shall be taken
to ascertain the fact of death before burial. Why not
revert to the old practice, and <i>always</i> open a vein in the
arm after death, or pass a current of electricity through
the body before the coffin is finally screwed down? It
may be held that these unpleasant resorts are unnecessary.
We do not think they are. In any case
enough is known of the possibilities of ‘suspended animation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>’
to render it unsafe to bury until the evidences
of an actual extinction of life are unmistakable; and, as
it is impossible to wait until decomposition sets in in all
cases of death from infectious diseases, it would be
prudent to adopt what must certainly be the least of
evils.”</p>

<p>If, as the <i>Lancet</i> maintains, it is not possible to wait
until the only absolute sign of death is manifest, then, in
a large majority of cases, there is no safety, and those
who die fatally mutilated by horrible accidents may be
considered fortunate. The difficulty, we admit, is of a
serious nature, particularly for the poor, and can only
be overcome by the erection of mortuaries, as discussed
in another chapter. The expedient of applying the
electric current, suggested by the <i>Lancet</i>, has been
proved useless in cases of death-trance, where the
patients are impervious to the most violent modes of
cutaneous excitation.</p>

<p>The <i>Jewish World</i>, September 13, 1895, observes:&mdash;“Cases
of trance and of the burial of persons who only
seemed to be dead, and of narrow escapes of others
from the most terrible of all imaginable fates, are not
so uncommon as most people suppose; and while Jews
adhere to the practice of interring their dead within a
few hours after the supposed demise, there will always
be a risk of such horrible catastrophes happening, even
more frequently among us than among the general
community. Here is, then, really a matter in which
some reform is needed, and that without a day’s delay.</p>

<div class="sidenote">OPINIONS OF THE “JEWISH WORLD.”</div>

<p>“To say nothing of the merely human aspect of this
important question, to bury until decomposition has
actually set in might possibly be shown to be a violation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
of Jewish Law. It is now commonly admitted that even
expert medical men cannot be absolutely certain of
death until some signs of decomposition have shown
themselves. Now, so strict is the Jewish Law as regards
the risk of destroying life, that it is prohibited to
even move or touch a man or woman who is on the
point of death, lest we hasten, by a moment, their
dissolution. It is, therefore, no less than a violation of
the Jewish laws against murder to preserve a custom
that involves even the minutest scintilla of risk of premature
burial. It is high time that this question was
seriously taken up by the Jewish clergy and laity.”<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>In the province of Quebec no interment is permitted
within twenty-four hours, and the Jews reconcile themselves
to this delay, which, however, is far too brief to
ensure safety.</p>

<p>It will be said that the danger referred to is not so
imminent in the United Kingdom as in France, Spain,
Portugal, or even in the United States, owing to the
existence of a more temperate climate, and the longer
period allowed for burial. This may be so and yet the
danger be considerable. It must be remembered that in
the rural districts nothing in the shape of examination
to establish the fact of death is practised; while in
certain parts of Cornwall, throughout the greater part
of agricultural Ireland, amongst the Jews in all cities
and towns, as well as those who in all places are certified
as dead of cholera, small-pox, and other infectious and
epidemic diseases, burial often follows certified death<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
quite as quickly as in the Continental States before
mentioned. In all the public resorts on the Continent
the hotel-keepers, through an insensate fear of death
and the injury which the possession of “a corpse,” dead
or alive, may do to their business, have them coffined
and disposed of, particularly in the night, within a few
hours of their supposed death. Dr. D. de Lignières, in
“Pour ne pas être Enterré Vivant,” Paris, 1893, says he
has known of burials under such circumstances six hours
after death. This author says that these scandalous
homicidal acts are of every-day occurrence, and that the
rapacious landlords have no difficulty in obtaining
certificates of death from the accommodating <i>mort
verificateurs</i>. Every one who visits the <i>hôtels des villes
d’eaux, des stations balnéaires</i>, may verify (he says) the
truth of this statement for himself. In short, these are
willing disciples of the “Latest Decalogue”:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pch">FEAR OF PREMATURE BURIAL.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Many</span> of those who are most familiar with the phenomena
of life and death, including celebrated physicians, men
of science, and clergymen, knowing that all the ordinary
signs of death (referred to in another chapter) have, in
practice, sometimes proved delusive, have been a prey
to the suspicion that a fatal mistake is possible in their
own case. They have, therefore, left precise instructions
in their wills for various preventives which experience
has shown to be necessary, and in some instances a
combination of these, so as to make doubly sure that
they shall not be subjected, like thousands of human
beings, to the unspeakable horrors of being buried
alive.</p>

<p>Mr. Horace Welby, in his volume entitled “Mysteries
of Life, Death, and Futurity,” 1861, under the head of
“Premature Interment,” p. 114, says:&mdash;“How prevalent
is the fear of being buried alive may be gathered from
the number of instances in which men have requested
that, before the last offices are done for them, such
wounds or mutilations should be inflicted upon their
bodies as would effectually prevent the possibility of an
awakening in the tomb. Dr. Dibdin relates that Francis
Douce, the antiquary, requested, in his will, that Sir
Anthony Carlisle, the surgeon, should sever his head
from his body, or take out his heart, to prevent the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
return of vitality; and his co-residuary legatee, Mr.
Kerrick, has also requested the same operation to be
performed in the presence of his son.”</p>

<p>Bishop Berkeley, Daniel O’Connell, and the late
Lord Lytton entertained similar apprehensions. Wilkie
Collins had a like fear, for he always left on his
dressing-table a letter in which he solemnly enjoined
his people that, if he were found dead in the morning,
he should at once be carefully examined by a doctor.
Hans Christian Andersen had a similar dread, and
carried in his pocket a note to the effect that, when
the time came, his friends were to make sure that he
was really dead before burial. Harriet Martineau left
her doctor ten pounds to see that her head was amputated
before burial. The dread of being buried
alive dictated a clause in the will of the distinguished
actress, the late Miss Ada Cavendish, for the severance
of the jugular vein; and prompted the late Mr. Edmund
Yates to leave similar instructions, with the provision
that a fee of twenty guineas should be paid for the
operation, which was carried out. Mr. John Rose, of
New York, who died in November, 1895, made known
his earnest desire that his coffin should not be closed,
but laid in the family vault at Roseton, and guarded
day and night by two caretakers, who were instructed
to watch for signs of reanimation.</p>

<p>The late Lady Burton, widow of Sir Richard Burton,
provided that her heart was to be pierced with a
needle, and her body to be submitted to a <i>post-mortem</i>
examination, and afterwards embalmed (not stuffed) by
competent experts. Lady Burton, it is said, had been
subject to fits of trance on more than one occasion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
and was terribly afraid that such an attack might be
diagnosed as death.</p>

<p>Those who are most apprehensive of apparent death
being mistaken for real death are the clergy and other
ministers of religion, and funeral directors&mdash;in other
words, those who know most about it.</p>

<p>Let anyone introduce the subject when in company,
on a suitable occasion, and we shall hear of startling
cases sufficient to shake credulity, and to compel us
to realise the danger to ourselves, as well as to all other
members of the community, under our present loose
customs. If this dread of premature burial is not
universal, as some writers and authorities aver, it is
certainly widely extended; and the evidence set before
our readers will show that it is by no means without
foundation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WIDELY EXTENDED.</div>

<p>The <i>Lancet</i>, March 17, 1866, says:&mdash;“There are many
apparently trustworthy stories afloat, both in this country
and on the Continent, which favour the belief that
premature interment not only does sometimes take
place, but is really of not so unfrequent occurrence as
might be supposed. Some few believe it to be not an
unlikely event, and break out into a cold perspiration
at the thought of the possibility of the misfortune
happening to themselves. Others have actually made
provision in their wills that means should be taken, by
cutting off a finger, or making a pectoral incision, etc.,
to excite sensibility, in case any should remain after
their supposed death; whilst a French countess, in order
to escape so terrible a fate, left a legacy to her medical
attendant as a fee for his severance of the carotid artery
in her body before it was committed to the tomb.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>The Rev. John Kingston, chaplain R.N., writing to
the (London) <i>Morning Post</i>, September 18, 1895, says&mdash;“The
danger of being buried alive appears to be a
very real one; and I can testify, from my experience
as a clergyman, that a great many persons are haunted
by the dread of that unspeakably horrible fate.” The
writer further expresses a hope that the ventilation of
the subject will be followed by practical results.</p>

<p>While speaking on the subject of premature burials,
in a lecture delivered at Everett Hall, Brooklyn, New
York, June, 1883, Mr. J. D. Beugless, the then President
of the New York Cremation Society, said that an
undertaker in that city (Brooklyn) recently made provision
in his will, and exacted a promise from his wife of
great caution, that his body should be cremated, being
induced thereto by the fear of being buried alive. “Live
burials,” he says, “are far more frequent than most
people think.” It is reported that another undertaker of
Brooklyn some time since deposited a body in a receiving
vault temporarily: when he went some days
later to remove it for burial, what was his horror, upon
opening the niche in which the coffin had been placed,
to find the body crouching at the door, stark in death,
the hair dishevelled, the flesh of the arms lacerated
and torn, and the face having the most appalling
expression of horror and despair ever witnessed by
mortal eyes!</p>

<p>An undertaker, writing to the <i>Plymouth Morning
News</i>, October 2, 1895, mentions that he reluctantly
buried a young person, who lay in the coffin for seven
clear days without sign of decomposition, and only
consented to close the coffin then, on the assurance that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
the same conditions attended all the deaths which had
previously occurred in the family. Dr. Hartmann and
other authorities have found that such cases are probably
the subjects of catalepsy, a malady which sometimes runs
in families and affects every member. The undertaker
adds that, in future, he should decline to close the coffin
of the apparently dead until signs of decomposition
set in, “thus preventing the possibility of our worst
fears being realised.” If undertakers generally would
adopt these wise and necessary precautions, living
sepulture would come to an end. Under the existing imperfect
system of medical examination&mdash;and, as we have
shown, both in England and in the United States, where
there is usually no examination at all&mdash;there is often
a reckless haste in interments. No thoughtful persons
can contemplate the burial of a million and a half
human beings annually in these two countries without
mistrust and misgivings.</p>

<p>Many well-to-do people in civilised countries provide
in their wills for the prevention of premature interment,
by leaving instructions for surgical operations after their
decease, <i>post-mortems</i>, embalmment, or cremation. It
may happen, however, that wills are mislaid, lost, or
withheld by the testators, or are not opened and read
until after the funeral, when the instructions in this
regard, however strictly enjoined, are rendered abortive.
Legacies should be given conditionally on the observance
of certain duties, and only payable on proofs to
the executors that they have been carried out. A
large majority of people do not, however, leave testamentary
instructions, for the simple reason that they
have nothing to bequeath. And the majority have an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
equal claim with the minority to be safeguarded by the
State against such terrible misfortunes. Syncope, sometimes
mistaken for death, is a condition to which both
men and women, who are compelled by their poverty
in all large cities to endure exhausting labours in ill-ventilated
work-rooms, and their often ill-nourished
children in board schools in England and in the public
schools in America, are peculiarly liable.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<p class="pch">SUDDEN DEATH.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> idea commonly entertained is that with animal
bodies there are only two possible conditions&mdash;either life
or death; that the presence of one of these conditions
implies the absence of the other; that when the body
has assumed the appearance of death, as during the
sudden suspension of all the functional activities, it must
be dead. This last is far from being true; for all the
appearances of death are fallacious, especially those
that accompany so-called sudden death. All such cases
should be challenged as of doubtful character, and held
so till recovery or putrefaction of the tissues proves the
presence of life or of death. This subject is too often
treated by medical writers with indifference. Technically,
it is regarded as a failure of the brain, or lungs, or heart,
to perform their functions; popularly, we say that “the
thread of life is snapped asunder;” or it is “the going
out of life,” like the sudden extinguishing of a candle.
The author’s experience, however, at the sick bedside,
and in the death-chamber, has taught him that life
leaves the body in a gradual manner, and that death
approaches, and takes the place of life, in one part or
organ after another, thus creeping through the tissues,
and sometimes defying all tests to prove its presence,
leaving putrefaction to be its only sign. There can be no
such thing as veritable sudden death, unless the body is
crushed into a shapeless mass, like an insect under foot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>The late Dr. Farr, of the Registrar-General’s Department,
London, says:&mdash;“No definition of the sense in
which <i>sudden death</i> is practically understood by coroners
has been given.” Dr. Granville says: “The writers on
medical jurisprudence do not state with any strictness
what they mean by sudden death, whether it be death
in ten minutes, ten hours, or ten days.”<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> And he asks
in the same vein, “Does sudden death mean death in
three minutes, three hours, or three days?”<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Still
further he remarks regarding the customary definitions,
“They lead one to infer that a certain mysterious principle,
called <span class="smcap">LIFE</span>, has been instantaneously withdrawn
from a healthy and well-constituted individual, who was
at the very moment, as heretofore, exercising his proper
animal functions with a regularity that promised to
endure for a long continuance of years.... No such
phenomena occur in Nature, unless through violence or
from accident. Under Nature’s laws there is no such
thing as sudden death.... In every case where
death has abruptly cut short the thread of life, there
has been a preparation, more or less antecedent to the
occurrence, which must inevitably have led to it....
The victim may seem to have been struck down, as if by
lightning. But in reality the event was only the natural
termination of an inward state of things which insidiously
and unexpectedly was preparing the blow.”<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">DR. TIDY ON CAUSES OF DEATH.</div>

<p>Dr. Tidy, in “Legal Medicine,” p. 29, says:&mdash;“As a
rule, the action required to bring about complete molecular
death&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, the suspension of vital activity in every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
part&mdash;is progressive. In a given case, therefore, we are
unable to state any definite time as the period of its
occurrence. The popular idea of death is that the entire
body dies at once. Somatic death is an impossibility.”
Thus, it is clear that the process of death, or the departure
of life, may require days or weeks for its completion;
and it may even be delayed to a time when putrefaction
has set in quite generally, as when the hair and nails
grow after the body has been buried some weeks, as has
been credibly reported. Writers upon so-called sudden
death recite a number of diseases and conditions which
quickly destroy the machinery that carries on the vital
functions, thus rendering resuscitation quite impossible.
Tidy<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> names some twelve of such causes: prominent
among them are diseases of the heart, rupture of the
heart, clots in the blood vessels, aneurisms, effusions
of blood in the brain, bursting of visceral abscesses,
ulcers of the stomach, extra-uterine pregnancy, rupture
of the uterus or bladder, large draughts of cold water
taken when the body is heated, cholera, alcoholic poisoning,
mental emotions, etc. But he remarks upon these
causes&mdash;“Because a person dies suddenly, there being
no evidence of violence or poison, the action adopted
by many coroners in not requiring a <i>post-mortem</i> examination
leaves the most important witness&mdash;the dead
body itself&mdash;unheard, and the inquest so far valueless.”
Which may mean that, without the risk of an autopsy, it
is impossible in such cases to determine whether they are
beyond resuscitation or not, unless putrefaction settles
the question. Unfortunately there is nothing in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
external appearance of those cases of so-called sudden
death in which the vital machinery may be totally
wrecked, to distinguish them from those of apparent
death, in which all the organism is in a state of
perfect integrity, and in which resuscitation is possible,
provided the vital principle has not entirely left the
body. Consequently, the only safe rule to observe
in all cases in which death has not followed poisoning,
or injuries which kill outright, or some known
disease of sufficient duration and severity to bring on
dissolution, is to wait for unmistakable evidences of
decomposition before autopsy, embalming, cremation, or
burial is allowed.</p>

<p>In former times precipitate interments of persons who
died suddenly were specially guarded against.</p>

<p>Nothing is more common, on opening a newspaper,
than to see one or more announcements of sudden
death. These occurrences are so frequent that the
great London dailies, except when an inquest is held, or
when the deceased is a person of note, omit to record
them. The narratives are much alike: the person,
described to be in his usual health, is seized with faintness
in the midst of his daily-avocation, and he falls
down apparently dead; or he retires for the night, and
is found dead in his bed. In many instances <i>post-mortems</i>
are made, and an inquest held; but in other
cases the opinion of the attendant doctor, that the
death is due to heart-disease, syncope, asphyxia, coma,
apoplexy, or “natural causes,” is deemed sufficient. The
friends who are called in to look at the body will remark,
“how natural and how life-like,” “how flexible the
limbs,” “how placid the face;” and, without the faintest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
attempt at resuscitation, arrangements are made for an
early burial.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DR. WILDER ON SUDDEN DEATH.</div>

<p>Dr. Alexander Wilder, Professor of Physiology and
Psychology, in a letter to the author, says:&mdash;“There are
a variety of causes for sudden death. The use of tobacco
is one. Another is overtaxed nervous system. Men of
business keep on the strain till they drop from sheer
exhaustion. At the base of the brain is a little nerve-ganglion,
the medulla oblongata, which, once impaired,
sends death everywhere. Overtaxing the strength by
study and mental stress will do this. The solar ganglion
below the diaphragm is the real vital focus of the body.
It is first to begin, last to die. A blow on it often kills.
An emotion will paralyse it. Even undue excess at a
meal, or the use of overmuch alcohol, may produce the
effect.</p>

<p>“Tobacco impairs the action of the heart. An
overfull stomach paralyses the ganglionic store, and
breathing is likely to stop. It is dangerous in such
cases to lie on the back. All these deaths are by
heart-failure.” It is syncope where the heart fails
first; asphyxia where the lungs are first to cease; coma
when the brain is first at fault. “Natural causes”
and “heart-failure” usually mean, like “congestion,”
that the doctor’s ideas are vague.</p>

<p>Dr. Wilder continues:&mdash;“I would choose such a death
if I could be sure it was death. <i>But most of those things
which I have enumerated may cause a death which is only
apparent.</i>”</p>

<p>The following briefly extracted cases from English
papers are typical of thousands of others, and can be
duplicated, with slight variation in terms, throughout the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
United States. The absolute proof of the reality of
such deaths is not found in hasty diagnosis or in medical
certificates, but in the presence of putrefaction:&mdash;</p>

very different from those in vogue are taken to
prevent them. All medical practitioners allow that a
man may be half drowned or half dead, and that cases
of suspended animation occur where the most experienced
physician is unable to detect the faintest indication of
breathing or cardiac movement. They are, however,
quite sceptical as to absolute suspensions of life where
all the ordinary methods to test its existence fail; and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
owing to this scepticism, and the readiness to give
certificates of death in cases of alleged sudden death,
have unwittingly promoted premature burials, as will
appear by the facts quoted in these pages.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HASTY BURIAL CONDEMNED.</div>

<p>Mr. M. Cooper, in the “Uncertainty of the Signs
of Death,” p. 49, cites from a letter by one William
Fabri, a surgeon, the opinion that we “... have
just reason to condemn the too precipitate interment
of persons overpowered by lethargies, apoplexies, or
suffocation of the matrix; for I know there have been
some, supposed to be irretrievably cut off by these
disorders, who, resuming strength and returning to life,
have raised the boards of their own coffins, because in
such disorders the soul only retires, as it were, to her
most secret and concealed residence, in order to make
the body afterwards sensible that she had not entirely
forsaken it.” These wise counsels were written two
hundred and sixty-eight years ago, since which time
thousands of our fellow-creatures have, it is feared, been
the victims of premature interment, and yet the danger
then pointed out remains. The <i>Undertakers’ and Funeral
Directors’ Journal</i>, the conductors of which are laudably
anxious to keep their profession from the odium of
burying people alive, referring to sudden deaths and
this danger, says, in its issue of January 24, 1894, under
the head of “A Burning Question”:&mdash;“Sufferers from
such chronic ailments as are reputed to end suddenly
are in constant danger from the present state of the law,
if they are in the hands of people interested in their
death.” And continues: “Even where a medical certificate
is obtained, such general laxity has entered into
proceedings that but little protection is thereby afforded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
to the public. While the medical man is bound to state
what he believes to be the cause of death, he is under
no obligation to make sure either that the patient is
dead at all, or that, if dead, he died from a particular
disease for which he was attending him.”</p>

<p class="psh">VIVISECTION.</p>

<p>The <i>Medical Times and Gazette</i>, 1859, vol. xviii.,
p. 256, has the following:&mdash;</p>


<div class="pbq">

<p class="pc1">“A CRIMINAL’S HEART.</p>

<p>“We find in an account taken from the ‘Boston Medical and
Surgical Journal’ some observations on the heart of a hanged
criminal, which are remarkable in a moral point of view, as well as
in their scientific aspect. The man died, it appears, as the phrase is,
without a struggle; and, therefore, probably in the first instance, he
fell into a syncope. The lungs and brain were found normal. Seven
minutes after suspension, the heart’s sounds were distinctly heard,
its pulsations being one hundred a minute; two minutes later they
were ninety-eight; and in three minutes sixty, and very feeble. In
two minutes more the sounds became inaudible. The man was
suspended at ten o’clock, and his body was cut down twenty-five
minutes afterwards. There was then neither sound nor impulse.
At 10.40 the cord was relaxed, and then the face became gradually
pale; the spinal cord was uninjured.... At 11.30 a regular
movement of pulsation was observed in the right subclavian vein;
and on applying the ear to the chest, there was heard a regular,
distinct, and single beat, accompanied with a slight impulse.
Hereupon Drs.. Clark, Ellis, and Shaw open the thorax, and
expose the heart, which still continues to beat! The right
auricle contracted and dilated with energy and regularity. At
twelve o’clock the pulsations were forty in a minute; at 1.45 five
per minute. They ceased at 2.45; but irritability did not entirely
disappear until 3.18, more than five hours after suspension. ‘This
fact,’ says M. Séquard, ‘demonstrates that in a man, unfortunately,
even when syncope exists for some minutes at the commencement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
of strangulation, the ventricles of the heart cease to beat almost
as quickly as they do in strangulation without syncope.’ With
regard to the moral aspects of this case, the same gentleman
remarks:&mdash;‘People will probably be surprised that the body of
this man should have been opened while the beating of the heart
was still audible. We will not ask here if the doctors committed
or not a blamable action; we will only say that we know them
personally, and that, if they have in part merited the violent
reproaches addressed to them, they are, nevertheless, <i>hommes
de cœur</i>, who, in an excess of scientific zeal, did not notice that the
body upon which they experimented was not, perhaps, at the time
a dead body.’”</p></div>

<p class="p1">Syncope, however, is not a disease, though often certified
as such, but is merely a symptom of certain maladies, or a
manifestation of suspended animation from unascertained
cause. In Hoblyn’s “Dictionary of Medical Terms,”
p. 632, syncope is described as&mdash;“Fainting or swoon; a
sudden suspension of the heart’s action, accompanied by
cessation of the functions of the organs of respiration,
internal and external sensation, and voluntary motion.”
<span class="sidenote">DEATHS ATTRIBUTED TO SYNCOPE.</span>There appears, therefore, every probability that, with
careless or ignorant medical practitioners, syncope is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
seldom mistaken for trance, and a certificate of death may
be given where there is merely a suspension and not a
termination of life; and this probability is reduced to a
certainty when we learn the number of premature
burials and narrow escapes reported by Winslow, Bruhier,
Köppen, E. Bouchut, Lénormand, F. Kempner, Moore
Russell Fletcher, Gannal, Gaubert, Hartmann, and other
recognised authorities. Dr. James Curry, Senior Physician
to Guy’s Hospital, and Lecturer on the Theory
and Practice of Medicine, in the introduction to his
“Observations on Apparent Death,” London, 1815, 2 ed.,
p. 1, says&mdash;“The time is still within the recollection of
many now living when it was almost universally believed
that <i>life</i> quitted the body in a very few minutes after the
person had ceased to breathe. Remarkable examples
to the contrary were, indeed, upon record; but these,
besides being extremely rare, were generally cases
wherein the <i>suspension</i>, as well as the <i>recovery of life</i>,
had occurred <i>spontaneously</i>; they were, therefore, beheld
with astonishment, as particular instances of Divine
Interposition.” It is believed that the majority of the
members of the medical profession still entertain the
idea that a human being is dead when breathing can no
longer be detected, as in the cases of reported sudden
deaths; and, except in those which occur from drowning,
or suffocation through noxious gases, attempts are very
rarely made to promote restoration, and, unless they
return to life spontaneously while above ground, there
are good reasons to fear that an appreciable number do so
under ground. The prevailing belief in the existence of
sudden deaths is one of the chief causes of the terrible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
mistakes that lead to live burials. If this delusive
idea were removed, those concerned, such as physicians,
undertakers, relatives, and friends, would treat a person
who unexpectedly took on the appearance of death as
one needing careful attention by physician and nurse to
bring him round to health again, as is usually done in
cases of fainting. If trance were understood, doctors
would be on the lookout for it; but, as it is not understood,
it is called death, and we bury our mistakes
under ground.</p>

<p>Dr. Hilton Fagge, while doubting whether there is
any foundation for the strong fear which many persons
entertain of being buried alive after supposed death,
allows that there is danger in cases of sudden death.
In his “Principles and Practice of Medicine,” Dr. Fagge
says: “The cases really requiring caution are some
very few instances of persons found in the streets, or
losing consciousness unexpectedly and in unusual circumstances.”<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>Dr. Léonce Lénormand, in “Des Inhumations Précipitées,”
p. 86, says that medical archives record details
of a great number of apoplectic cases revived after one,
two, and three days’ apparent death; and observes that
the most celebrated physicians, both ancient and modern,
agree in recommending delay in the burial of persons
who succumb to this affliction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>Dr. Franz Hartmann, in his “Premature Burial,” p. 11,
quotes the following:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<div class="sidenote1">REVIVAL AFTER APPARENT DEATH.</div>

<p class="p1">“In the Bukovina, a young woman, in the vicinity of Radautz,
died of spasms of the heart. They waited five days for the
funeral, because no signs of putrefaction appeared. The clergyman
then refused any longer delay, and the final arrangements
for interment were made. Just as they were about to put the
coffin into the grave, the sister of the deceased woman, who lived
at another place, arrived, and begged to be permitted to see the
dead body. Owing to her entreaties the coffin was opened, and
as the woman saw the unaltered features of her sister, she asserted
her belief that the supposed dead was still living. She procured
a red-hot poker, and, in spite of the remonstrances of those
present, she touched with it the soles of the feet of the corpse.
There was a spasmodic jerk, and the woman recovered. The
most remarkable thing was that the supposed dead woman had
not been unconscious for a moment, but was able to describe
afterwards all the details of what had taken place around her, from
the moment when she was supposed to die up to the time of her
recovery; but she had looked upon all that like an unconscious
spectator, and not experienced any sensation, nor was she able to
give any sign of life.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">In “Les Signes de la Mort,” by Dr. E. Bouchut, p. 51,
Dr. J. Schmid is cited for the case of a girl, seven years
of age, who, while playing with her companions, fell suddenly
down (as if struck by lightning), and died. There
was paleness, absence of pulse, insensibility to all stimulus.
Nevertheless, owing to the requests of the distressed
parents, the apparently hopeless attempts at resuscitation
were continued. After three quarters of an hour the girl
gave a sigh and recovered.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DR. WATERMAN’S CASE.</div>

<p>The <i>Medical Record</i>, New York, 1883, vol. xxiii.,
p. 236, contains a paper on “Revivification” (in cases
of sudden apparent death from heart-disease, and in
the still-born), by S. Waterman, M.D., New York<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
Case 1, February, 1880.&mdash;Mr. B&mdash;&mdash;, aged 84, suffered
from valvular disease of the heart, and likewise from
Bright’s disease. “One morning, while I was sitting
at his bedside and in friendly conversation with him,
he being to all appearance in a very happy mood of
mind, he suddenly fell back, his eyes became fixed
and glassy, a deadly pallor crept over his countenance,
respiration and the heart’s action ceased simultaneously,
and death seemed to have carried him
off suddenly and unexpectedly. It was this suddenness
of the event that impelled me to make efforts at
revivification. Two nephews of Mrs. B&mdash;&mdash;, who were
fortunately in the house, were brought under requisition,
and, under my direction, systematic artificial
movements were carried on for nearly thirty minutes,
when one deep inspiratory effort was made by the patient
himself. Thus encouraged, we redoubled our efforts for
ten minutes more; other inspiratory efforts followed in
quicker succession; the heart began to respond. Hardly
audible at first, it acquired force and momentum; it
could now be felt at the wrist; the deadly pallor passed
away, the eyes lost their glassy, fixed aspect, sighs and
groans could be heard, twitchings of the muscles of the
arm and fingers could be distinctly felt, and the appearances
of death made way for reanimated conditions. He
lay unconscious for more than ten hours, respiration
being hurried, and breathing stertorous, the heart’s
action wild and irregular. During the night he was
delirious and restless; toward morning all untoward
symptoms subsided, and a quiet sleep followed the
extreme restlessness.... He died six weeks afterwards,
under symptoms of uræmic toxication. During<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
these six weeks he had several other attacks&mdash;one very
prolonged and almost fatal&mdash;in which artificial respiration
was resorted to with the same success.”</p>

<p>The editor of the <i>Manchester Criterion</i>, December 11,
1895, says:&mdash;“Many cases of sudden death have been
entombed who were really alive, so far as the union of
the body and soul is concerned. Sudden disappearance
of life is very common, due to excessive weakness or
a partial cessation of the heart’s action; and doctors
should be very chary in giving death-certificates until it
has been ascertained that decomposition has ensued.
Many object to this delay, and on the approach of an
indication of death, or apparent death, often hurry the
body to the grave. We know of a young lady, for
whom the shroud was bought, and the crape fastened
on the door, who was restored to life.”</p>

<p class="psh">SUDDEN DEATH.</p>

<p>Professor Alexander Wilder, M.D., in “Perils of
Premature Burial,” p. 16, says:&mdash;“In this country
(America), however, the peril of interment before death
has actually taken place is very great. For years past
it has been a very common occurrence for persons in
supposed good health to fall down suddenly, with every
appearance of having died. We do not regard sudden
death with terror, as it is so often painless, and exempts
the individual from the anxiety and other unpleasant
experiences which so often accompany a lingering dissolution.
But there is a terrible liability of being
prostrated by catalepsy, the counterpart of death, under
such circumstances that those who have the body in
charge will not hesitate about a prompt interment.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">PREVENTIVE LEGISLATION.</div>

<p>“The difficulty of distinguishing a person apparently
dead from one who is <i>really</i> so has, in all countries
where bodies are interred precipitately, rendered it
necessary for the law to assist humanity. Of several
regulations made on this subject, a few of the most
recent may suffice&mdash;such as those of Arras in 1772; of
Mantua in 1774; of the Grand Duke of Tuscany in
1775; of the Senechaussée of Sivrai in Poitou in 1777;
and of the Parliament of Metz in the same year....
These edicts forbid the precipitate interment of persons
who die suddenly. Magistrates of health are to be
informed, that physicians may examine the body; that
they may use every endeavour to recall life, if possible,
or to discover the cause of death.”&mdash;<i>Encyclopædia

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

<p class="pch">SIGNS OF DEATH.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> absence of respiration is the most ordinary sign of
death, but at the same time perhaps the one most likely
to deceive. To ascertain whether breathing be entirely
suspended, it is a practice to hold a looking-glass to
the face.</p>

<p class="pi10 p1">“Lend me a looking-glass;</p>
<p class="pin6">If that her breath will mist or stain the stone,<br />
Why, then, she lives.”&mdash;<i>King Lear</i>, Act v., Sc. 3.</p>

<p class="p1">The common belief is that, if the operations of the
heart or lungs be arrested for ever so brief a period,
they will never be resumed, and upon a hasty diagnosis
and perhaps a trifling experiment the person is declared
dead. It would appear presumptuous to attempt to
doubt or deny a theory so widely accepted by both the
lay and medical world, but numerous well-attested facts
show that the action of the vital organs, with life itself,
may occasionally be actually suspended, as proved by
the most rigorous tests known to science, and that
various forms of suspended animation taking on the
appearance of actual death are of not unfrequent occurrence.
Scepticism, prejudice, and apathy on this subject
have led to thousands of persons being consigned to the
grave to return to consciousness in that hopeless and
dreadful prison.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">VARIOUS TESTS CONSIDERED.</div>

<p>One of the most distinguished physicians in London
informed the author that, being called in to decide a
case of apparent or real death, he had applied the
stethoscope and failed to detect the faintest pulsation
in the heart, and yet the woman recovered. The
danger of premature burial he believed to be very real
and by no means an imaginary one, and his opinions
were well known in the profession.</p>

<p class="psh">THE RESPIRATORY TEST.</p>

<p>Sir Benjamin Ward Richardson, in his paper on “The
Absolute Signs and Proofs of Death,” in the <i>Asclepiad</i>,
No. 21 (1889), vol. vi., p. 6, says:&mdash;</p>

<p>“About the existence of respiratory movements there
is always some cause for doubt, even amongst skilled
observers; for so slight a movement of respiration is
sufficient to carry on life, at what I have in another
paper designated ‘life at low tension,’ the most practised
eye is apt to be deceived.”</p>

<p>“The cessation of the indications of respiratory function,
although useful in a general sense, is not by any
means reliable. It is quite certain that in poisoning by
chloral, and in catalepsy, there may be life when no
external movement of the chest is appreciable.”&mdash;<i>Ibidem,
pp. 13, 14.</i></p>

<p class="psh">CARDIAC AND ARTERIAL FAILURE TEST.</p>

<p>“Equal doubt attends the absence of the arterial
pulsations and heart sounds. It is quite certain that
the pulses of the body, as well as the movements and
sounds of the heart, may be undetectable at a time when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
the body is not only not dead but actually recoverable.”&mdash;<i>Ibidem,
p. 14.</i></p>

<p>In a review of several works on the “Signs of Death”
in <i>The British and Foreign Medical and Chirurgical
Review</i>, vol. <span class="smcap">xv</span>. [1855], p. 74, W. B. Kesteven writes
that Bouchut’s test of the cessation of the action of
the heart for one or two minutes is not to be relied
upon as a certain sign of death. “M. Josat has
recorded several instances wherein newly-born children
have been most carefully examined during several
minutes without the detection of the slightest cardial
sound or movement, and yet these have rallied and
lived. M. Depaul has collected ten similar instances.
M. Brachet has recorded<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> an instance of a man in
whom neither sound nor movement of the heart could
be heard for eight minutes, and who, nevertheless,
survived. Another adult case is mentioned by Dr.
Josat as having been witnessed by M. Girbal, of
Montpellier.... Sir B. Brodie and others have
described children born without hearts. The circulation
is maintained at one period of human life without
the aid of the heart. It is, besides, quite consistent
with the facts observed in hysterical and other conditions
of the nervous system, that the action of the
heart, like that of other muscles, should be so extremely
feeble as not to be cognisable by any sound or impulse,
and yet it may have sufficient movement slowly to move
the blood through the system, whose every function and
endowment is suspended and all but annihilated. In
cases of catalepsy, and of authentic instances of apparent
death, the respiratory muscles have not been seen to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
move, yet inspiration and expiration&mdash;however slowly
and imperceptibly&mdash;must have taken place.”</p>

<p class="psh">THE PUTREFACTIVE TEST.</p>

<p>Dr. Roger S. Chew, of Calcutta, whose personal experiences
of apparent death are elsewhere recorded in
this volume, says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE PUTREFACTIVE TEST.</div>

<p>“Numerous expedients have been suggested as means
of ascertaining whether a body is really dead or whether
the animation is temporarily suspended; but, though
these suggestions may collectively yield a correct diagnosis,
still they are valueless when separately considered,
and cannot compare with the ‘putrefaction test.’”</p>

<p>In the “Principles and Practice of Medicine” of the
late Dr. Hilton Fagge, edited by Dr. Pye-Smith, vol. i.,
p. 19, of the second edition, is the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>“In most cases there is no difficulty in determining
the exact moment at which death occurs. But sometimes
it cannot be fixed with certainty, and there are
some altogether exceptional instances (though I have
never myself met with one) in which for hours, or even
for days, it remains uncertain whether life is extinct or
merely suspended. <i>I believe that the only sign of death
which is both certain to manifest itself in the course of a
few days, and also absolutely conclusive and infallible, is
the occurrence of putrefaction</i>, which is generally first
indicated by discoloration of the surface of the abdomen.
And in any case admitting of doubt, the coffin should
not be closed until this has shown itself.” (Italics ours.)</p>

<p>The <i>Medical Examiner</i>, Philadelphia, vol. vi., p. 610,
says:&mdash;</p>

<p>“A recent French reviewer in the <i>Gazette Médicale</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
closes a survey of the differences between real and
apparent death, by the following remarks:&mdash;‘Experience,’
says he, ‘has shown the insufficiency of each of
these signs, with one exception&mdash;<i>putrefaction</i>. The
absence of respiration and circulation, the absence of
contractility and sensibility, general loss of heat, the
hippocratic face, the cold sweat spreading over the body,
cadaveric discoloration, relaxation of the sphincters, loss
of elasticity, the flattening of the soft parts on which
the body rests, the softness and flaccidity of the eyes,
the opacity of the fingers, cadaveric rigidity, the expulsion
of alimentary substances from the mouth;&mdash;all
these signs combined or isolated may present themselves
in an individual suffering only from apparent death.’”</p>

<p>Prof. D. Ferrier, in an article on “Signs of Death” in
Quain’s “Dictionary of Medicine,” pp. 327, 328, says:&mdash;</p>

<p>“It is not always easy to determine when the spark
of life has become finally extinguished. From fear of
being buried alive, which prevails more abroad than in
this country, some infallible criterion of death, capable
of being applied by unskilled persons, has been considered
a desideratum, and valuable prizes have been
offered for such a discovery. The conditions most
resembling actual death are syncope, asphyxia, and
trance, particularly the last. We cannot, however, say
that any infallible criterion applicable by the vulgar has
been discovered.”</p>

<p>The writer then proceeds to describe the various
symptoms usually considered to denote death. The
chief of these is putrefaction, but he observes that
putrefaction may occur locally during life, and general
septic changes may occur to some extent before death.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>Dr. Gannal, in “Signes de la Mort,” p. 31, says:&mdash;</p>

<p>“I share the opinion of the majority of authors who
have written on this subject, and I consider <i>putrefaction</i>
as the only certain sign of death.” The author then
shows that all other signs are uncertain, and adds “that
it is possible, by taking certain measures, to wait until
putrefaction is well manifest, without injuring the public
health.” If the attending medical practitioner could
always be relied upon to look for any such combination
of signs as above suggested, there would be much less
danger of premature burial than at present almost
everywhere prevails; but personal investigation obliges
the author deliberately to declare that these are looked
for only in a comparatively few instances.</p>

<p class="pch"><i>RIGOR MORTIS.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">RIGOR MORTIS.</div>

<p>With reference to <i>rigor mortis</i>, one of the signs many
physicians regard as infallible as putrefaction, and to
which the <i>British Medical Journal</i> attaches much importance,
I cite the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>Dr. Samuel Barker Pratt says that <i>rigor mortis</i>,
which is regarded as an absolute proof of death, is in
itself a life-action, caused by a gradual withdrawal of
the nerve-forces from the body, and is distinctly akin to,
and the same in effect as, the tightening of a muscle, and
other similar physiological actions in the living body.</p>

<p>Dr. Roger S. Chew observes:&mdash;</p>

<p>“<i>Rigor mortis</i> is a condition that seldom or never
supervenes in the hot weather in India, and is often a
feature of catalepsy.</p>

<p>“Ecchymoses, or <i>post-mortem</i> stains, are sometimes of
value, but very frequently they do not appear, even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
though there are strong evidences of putrefaction having
set in, and in some cases this cadaveric lividity, as it is
termed, may be the result of violence received before
animation was suspended, and, the vital spark not having
been extinguished though the body was apparently
dead, echymosis had asserted itself as a process of life,
and not death.”</p>

<p>Ebenezer Milner, M.D.Edinb., L.R.C.S.E., observes
in a paper on “Catalepsy or Trance” in the <i>Edinburgh
Medical and Surgical Journal</i>, 1850, vol. lxxiv., p. 330:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Patients labouring under an intense and prolonged
paroxysm of catalepsy have been supposed to be dead,
and have been interred alive.</p>

<div class="sidenote">VARIOUS OTHER TESTS.</div>

<p>“There are numerous cases of this kind on record,
and many more where individuals, after being laid in
their coffins, have fortunately recovered from the attack
before the period of interment. In such cases respiration
is insensible, and the heart’s action is almost in
abeyance; the surface of the body is nearly cold, and
presents the pallor of death; and the articulations are
stiff. Although it is no doubt a difficult task to
distinguish this state of trance from the state of death,
yet a careful examination of the body, and time, would
lead to a correct diagnosis. The limbs after death are
first lax, then stiff, and ultimately lax again. The
stiffness of the limbs, known as the cadaveric rigidity,
or <i>rigor mortis</i>, lasts for a longer or shorter time,
according to circumstances; the sooner it supervenes,
the shorter is its duration, and conversely. Now the
stiffness of the limbs accompanying this intense form
of trance supervenes at once, and lasts as long as the
paroxysm continues. This is consequently a valuable
diagnostic sign.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>It may be observed that only in rare and very exceptional
cases is time allowed for careful and accurate
diagnosis.</p>

sometimes supervenes on the last stage of the confluent

<p class="psh">THE PROPER VALUE OF THE DIAPHANOUS<br />
TEST OF DEATH,</p>

<p class="pn">by Edwin Haward, M.D.Edin., F.R.C.S.Eng., appears
in the <i>Lancet</i> of June 10, 1893, p. 1404:&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE DIAPHANOUS TEST.</div>

<p>“A case has come lately under my observation in
which the value of the diaphanous test of death has
been illustrated at its just worth, and, as the matter is
one of supreme practical moment, I think it may be
considered deserving a brief notice in the pages of the
<i>Lancet</i>. Readers of the <i>Lancet</i> need scarcely be informed
that the diaphanous test consists in taking a hand of a
supposed dead person, placing it before a strong artificial
light, with the fingers extended and just touching each
other, and then looking through the narrow spaces
between the fingers to see if there be there a scarlet line
of light. The theory is that if there be such a line of
scarlet colour there is some circulation still in progress,
and therefore evidence of vital action, whilst if there be
no illumination, then the circulation has ceased and
death has occurred. The French Academy of Medicine
was so impressed with the value of this test that it
awarded, I believe, to the discoverer of it a considerable
prize. The illustration I am about to give indicates,
however, that this test must be received with the utmost
caution. The facts run as follows:&mdash;I was called in
January last to visit a lady seventy-three years of age,
suffering from chronic bronchitis. She had often suffered
at intervals from similar attacks during a period of
twenty-five years. The present attack was very severe,
and as she was obviously in a state of senile decrepitude<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
her symptoms naturally gave rise to considerable
anxiety. Nevertheless, she rallied and improved so
much that after a few days my attendance was no
longer required. I heard nothing more of this lady
until February 6&mdash;a period of three weeks&mdash;when I was
summoned early in the morning to see her immediately.
The messenger told me that she had retired to bed in
the usual way, and had apparently died in the night,
but that she looked so life-like there was great doubt
whether death had actually taken place. Within half
an hour I was by her bedside; there was no sign of
breathing, of pulse, or of heart-beat, and the hands,
slightly flexed, were rather rigid, but the countenance
looked like that of a living person, the eyes being open
and life-like. I believed her to be dead, and that the
rigidity of the upper limbs indicated commencing <i>rigor
mortis</i>; but this curious fact was related to me by a
near relative, that once before she had passed into a
death-like state, with similar symptoms, even to the
rigidity of the arms and hands, from which state she
had recovered, and after which she had always experienced
the direst apprehension of being buried alive.
Her anxiety, it will be easily conceived, was readily
communicated to her relatives, who urged me to leave
nothing undone for determining whether life was or was
not extinct. Under the circumstances I suggested that
Dr. (now Sir) Benjamin Ward Richardson, who has
made the proofs of death a special study, should be
summoned. He soon arrived, and submitted the body
to all the tests in the following order:&mdash;1. Heart sounds
and motion entirely absent, together with all pulse
movement. 2. Respiratory sounds and movements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
entirely absent. 3. Temperature of the body taken
from the mouth the same as that in the surrounding
air in the room, 62° F. 4. A bright needle plunged
into the body of the biceps muscle (Cloquet’s needle
test) and left there shows on withdrawal no sign of
oxidation. 5. Intermittent shocks of electricity at different
tensions passed by needles into various muscles
and groups of muscles gave no indication whatever of
irritability. 6. The fillet-test applied to the veins of the
arm (Richardson’s test) causes no filling of veins on the
distal side of the fillet. 7. The opening of a vein to
ascertain whether the blood has undergone coagulation
shows that the blood was still fluid. 8. The subcutaneous
injection of ammonia (Monteverdi’s test) causes
the dirty brown stain indicative of dissolution. 9. On
making careful movements of the joints of the extremities,
of the lower jaw, and of the occipito-frontals, <i>rigor
mortis</i> is found in several parts. Thus of these nine
tests eight distinctly declared that death was absolute;
the exception, the fluidity of the blood, being a phenomenon
quite compatible with blood preternaturally fluid
and at a low temperature, even though death had
occurred. 10. There now remained the diaphanous test,
which we carried out by the aid of a powerful reflector
lamp, yielding an excellent and penetrating light. To
our surprise the scarlet line of light between the fingers
was as distinct as it was in our own hands subjected to the
same experiment. The mass of evidence was of course
distinctly to the effect that death was complete; but, to
make assurance doubly sure, we had the temperature of
the room raised and the body carefully watched until
signs of decomposition had set in. I made a visit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
myself on a succeeding day to assure myself of this
fact.</p>

<div class="sidenote">INADEQUACY OF DIAPHANOUS TEST.</div>

<p>“The results of these experimental tests were satisfactory,
as following and corroborating each other in eight
out of the ten different lines of procedure; but the point
of my paper is to show the utter inadequacy of the
diaphanous test, upon which some are inclined entirely
to rely. Sir Benjamin Richardson has reported an
instance in which the test applied to the hand of a
lady who had simply fainted gave no evidence of the
red line; she therefore, on that test alone, might have
been declared dead. In my case the reverse was
presented; the body was dead, whilst the red line
supposed to indicate life was perfectly visible. Hence
the test might possibly lead to a double error, and ought
never of itself to be relied upon.</p>

<p>“It is a question worthy of consideration whether the
colouration observed was due to the fluid state of the
blood after death; it is not unreasonable to suppose so
but I prefer merely to offer the suggestion without
further comment.”</p>

<p>Dr. Gannal, in his “Signes de la Mort,” p. 54, says:&mdash;</p>

<p>“The loss of transparency of the fingers is an uncertain
sign, because with certain subjects it takes place some
time before death; next, because it does not always
occur in the corpse; and finally, because it exists under
certain circumstances in sick persons&mdash;in intermittent
fever, for example, when the skin loses colour, the hands
get cold, and the nails blue, as happens at the onset of
the fits.”</p>

<p>Orfila, “Médicine Légale,” vol. i., p. 478, 4th edit.,
observes:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>“This sign can be of no use, because it is easy to
prove that the fingers of corpses placed between the
eye and the flame of a candle are transparent, even
when this experiment is made one or two days after
death.”</p>

<p>Sir Benjamin Ward Richardson read a paper before
the Medical Society of London on “The Absolute
Signs and Proofs of Death,” published (in 1889) in
No. 21 of the <i>Asclepiad</i>. The circumstance which
originated his investigation was a case of the revival
of an apparently dead child immediately before the
funeral. Dr. Richardson has seen persons apparently
dead, and presenting all the signs of death, but who
were really living. Amongst these he cites the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>“A medical man found dead, as it was presumed,
from an excessive dose of chloral. To all common
observation this gentleman was dead. There was no
sign of respiration; it was very difficult for an ear so
long trained as my own to detect the sounds of the
heart; there was no pulse at the wrist, and the
temperature of the body had fallen to 97° Fahr. In
this condition the man had lain for some hours before
my arrival; and yet, under the simple acts of raising
the warmth of the room to 84° Fahr. and injecting
warm milk and water into the stomach, he rallied
slowly out of the sleep, and made a perfect recovery.”</p>

<p>More remarkable is the case of a man struck by
lightning, details of which Sir Benjamin received, in
1869, from Dr. Jackson, of Somerby, Leicestershire.</p>

<p>“The patient reached his home in a state of extreme
prostration, in which he lay for a time, and then sank<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
into such complete catalepsy that he was pronounced
to be dead, and heard the sound of his own passing
bell from the neighbouring church; by a desperate
attempt at movement of his thumbs he attracted the
attention of the women engaged about him, and, being
treated as one still alive, recovered, and lived for several
years afterwards, retaining in his memory the facts, and
relating them with the most consistent accuracy.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">SIR B. W. RICHARDSON’S ENUMERATION.</div>

<p>Medical practitioners tell us that the signs of death
are quite easy and impossible to mistake. Dr. Richardson,
who has had the best of reasons, as already shown,
for observation and investigation, holds a different
opinion, and enumerates the signs of death as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) Respiratory failure, including absence of visible
movements of the chest, absence of the respiratory
murmur, absence of evidence of transpiration of water
vapour from the lungs by the breath.</p>

<p>(2) Cardiac failure, including absence of arterial
pulsation, of cardiac motion, and of cardiac sounds.</p>

<p>(3) Absence of turgescence or filling of the veins on
making pressure between them and the heart.</p>

<p>(4) Reduction of the temperature of the body below
the natural standard.</p>

<p>(5) Rigor mortis and muscular collapse.</p>

<p>(6) Coagulation of the blood.</p>

<p>(7) Putrefactive decomposition.</p>

<p>(8) Absence of red colour in semi-transparent parts
under the influence of a powerful stream of light.</p>

<p>(9) Absence of muscular contraction under the stimulus
of galvanism, of heat, and of puncture.</p>

<p>(10) Absence of red blush of the skin after subcutaneous
injection of ammonia (Monteverdi’s test).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>(11) Absence of signs of rust or oxidation of a bright
steel blade, after plunging it deep into the tissues. (The
needle test of Cloquet and Laborde.)</p>

<p>Sir Benjamin sums up as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>“If all these signs point to death&mdash;if there be no
indications of respiratory function; if there be no signs
of movement of the pulse or heart, and no sounds of the
heart; if the veins of the hand do not enlarge on the
distal side of the fillet; if the blood in the veins
contains a coagulum; if the galvanic stimulus fails
to produce muscular contraction; if the injection of
ammonia causes a dirty brown blotch&mdash;the evidence may
be considered conclusive that death is absolute. If
these signs leave any doubt, or even if they leave no
doubt, one further point of practice should be carried
out. The body should be kept in a room, the temperature
of which has been raised to a heat of 84° Fahr.,
with moisture diffused through the air; and in this
warm and moist atmosphere it should remain until
distinct indications of putrefactive decomposition have
set in.”</p>

<p>Dr. Franz Hartmann, whose recent monograph<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> has
excited much attention both in the English and
American Press, observes:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Apparent death is a state that resembles real
death so closely that even the most experienced persons
believe such a person to be really dead. In many cases
not even the most experienced physician, coroner, or
undertaker can distinguish a case of apparent death<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
from real death, neither by external examination nor
by means of the stethoscope, nor by any of the various
tests which have been proposed by this or that writer,
for all those tests have been proved fallible, and it is
now useless to discuss them at length, because many of
the most experienced members of the medical profession
have already agreed that there is no certain sign that a
person is really and not apparently dead, except the
beginning of a certain stage of putrefaction. All other
tests ought to be set down as delusive and unreliable.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">RULES FOR OFFICIAL INSPECTORS.</div>

<p>In the Royal Decree issued by the Government for
examining the dead in Würtemberg, dated January 24,
1882 (<i>Dienst-Vorschriften für Leichenschäuer</i>, Stuttgart,
1885), various signs and experiments for enabling the
official inspector of deaths to ascertain if actual death
has taken place are laid down. Among these are:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) “The cessation of sensibility may be assumed if,
on raising the eyelid, the pupil remains unaltered when
a lighted candle is held close to it; or if pungent
odours, such as those derived from onions, vinegar, sal-ammoniac,
or severe friction of the chest, arms, or soles
of the feet, the application of mustard, or burning tinder,
or if sealing-wax dropped upon the chest produces no
reaction, and particularly if in the latter case the skin
does not blister.</p>

<p>(2) “The stoppage of the circulation of the blood,
apart from the absence of heart beating, if, after tying a
tight bandage around the arm, the veins do not swell
up, upon the hands being firmly gripped; also if, upon
pricking the lips, no blood escapes; furthermore, if, on
holding the hand in front of a bright light (the diaphanous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
test), the finger-tips are no longer translucent as in
the living.”</p>

<p>Nor should the inspector ever neglect to examine the
heart to ascertain the complete absence of all sound,
and to test the absence of breath by other experiments.</p>

<p>The rescript further adds that these experiments
“may not furnish absolute proof of death,” and describes
what further proceedings to institute. These
are referred to in this volume in the chapter devoted to
Death Certification.</p>

<p>An editorial note in the <i>Lancet</i>, January 29, 1887,
p. 233, shows the difficulty of distinguishing real from</p>

<p class="psh">APPARENT DEATH.</p>

<p>“It was only last year that we commented in our
columns upon the ‘signs of death,’ drawing attention
to the more important criteria by which a skilful
observer may avoid mistaking cases of so-called suspended
animation from actual disease.<span class="sidenote">CASES FROM THE “LANCET.”</span> Quite recently
two instances have been recorded, in which, if report be
true, it would seem there is still room for maturing the
judgment upon the question herein raised. At Saumur
a young man afflicted with a contagious disease apparently
died suddenly. His body was enshrouded and
coffined, but as the undertaker’s men were carrying the
‘remains’ to their last resting-place they heard what
they believed to be a knocking against the coffin-lid,
and the sound was repeated in the grave. Instead of
testing at once the evidence of their senses, they, in
accordance with judicial custom, sent for the Mayor,
in whose presence the lid was removed from the coffin.
Whereupon, to the horror of the spectators, it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
observed that the dead man had only just succumbed
to asphyxia. The above narrative seems on the face
of it too ghastly to be true, especially as the occupant
of the coffin must have been shut up in a space containing
oxygen in quantity totally inadequate to sustain
an approximation to ordinary breathing. But in cataleptic
and similar states the organic functions are
reduced to the lowest ebb, and history records several
instances in which, for a time at least, the determination
of the living state was a matter of uncertainty. In our
issue of the 15th inst., p. 129, the reader will find an
account of ‘Post-mortem Irritability of Muscle,’ in which
the phenomenon was manifested in a marked degree
two hours after death from a chronic wasting disorder&mdash;a
condition which favours early extinction of vital
action in muscle. It may be argued, then, with some
show of reasonableness, that it is quite possible for the
heart to stand still, as it were, and yet retain the power
of action, although experience tells us but little on the
question as regards the human subject. Experiments
on the lower animals, however, show that over-distension
of the right cavities of the heart causes cessation of
cardiac contraction, and that relief from the distension
may be followed by resumption of the function of contractibility.
It must not be forgotten that an analogous
condition is witnessed at times in patients suffering from
capillary bronchitis or other physical states underlying
acute distension of the right heart; for, in these cases,
venesection is not uncommonly instrumental in arresting
the rapidly failing cardiac contractions. The second case
of apparent death alluded to above happened in ‘the
land of big things.’ An inhabitant of Mount Joy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
Paramatta, was believed to be dead, and his supposed
remains were about to be committed to the earth, when
a mourning relative startled the bystanders by exclaiming,
‘I must see my father once more; something tells me
he is not dead.’ The coffin was taken from the grave
to the sexton’s tool-house, and there opened, and was
found to contain a living inmate, who justified the
presentiment of his son by ‘slowly recovering.’ As no
mention is made in either case of the period that elapsed
between the occurrence of apparent death and the body
being placed in the coffin, or of the time during which
the encasement lasted, special and minute criticism is
uncalled for. Enough has been said on the subject to
emphasize the exhortation, ‘Get knowledge, and with
all thy getting get understanding.’”</p>

<p>The <i>British Medical Journal</i>, of September 28, 1895,
in a leading article on the “Signs of Death,” says:&mdash;</p>

<p>“The question of the possibility of the interment of
living beings has recently been exercising the minds of
a portion of the public, whose fears have found expression
in a series of letters to some of the daily papers.
It is a matter of regret that so much irresponsible nonsense
and such hysterical outpourings should find a
place in the columns of our great daily press. No
attempt at the production of evidence in support of
their beliefs or fears has been made by the majority of
writers, whilst the cases mentioned by the few are either
the inventions of the credulous or ignorant, or are
destitute of foundation. It cannot be said that the few
medical men who have joined in this public correspondence
have either contributed any useful information or
have seriously attempted to allay the fears of the public.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
One medical gentleman managed to earn for himself a
cheap notoriety by employing, with very scanty acknowledgment
of the source, copious extracts from Dr. Gowers’
article on ‘Trance’ in Quain’s ‘Dictionary of Medicine.’</p>

<p>“The possibility of apparent death being mistaken for
real death can only be admitted when the decision of
the reality of death is left to ignorant persons. We are
quite unprepared to admit the possibility of such a
mistake occurring in this country to a medical practitioner
armed with the methods for the recognition of
death that modern science has placed at his disposal.
Moreover, even by the ignorant the reality of death can
only be questioned during the period preceding putrefaction.
During this period various signs of death
appear which, taken collectively, allow of an absolute
opinion as to the reality of death being given. To each
of these, as a sign of death, exception may perhaps be
individually taken, but a medical opinion is formed from
a conjunction of these signs, and not from the presence
of an individual one.”</p>

<p>The writer must surely have overlooked the able
treatises by Winslow, Kempner, Russell Fletcher, Hartmann,
Gannal, and others, supported by evidence in the
aggregate of thousands of cases of premature burial or
narrow escapes, or have forgotten the dreadful cases
which have appeared from time to time in the <span class="sidenote">THE “BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL.”</span> columns
of the <i>British Medical Journal</i> itself. Commenting
upon the case of a child nearly buried alive, this medical
authority in its issue of October 31, 1885, under the
head of “Death or Coma,” sensibly refers to some of the
difficulties in distinguishing apparent from real death as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>“The close similarity which is occasionally seen to
connect the appearance of death with that of exhaustion
following disease, was lately illustrated in a somewhat
striking manner. An infant, seized with convulsions,
was supposed to have died about three weeks ago at
Stamford Hill. After five days’ interval, preparations
were being made for its interment, when, at the grave’s
mouth, a cry was heard to come from the coffin. The
lid was taken off, and the child was found to be alive,
was taken home, and is recovering. Such is the published
account of the latest recorded case of suspended
animation. We need not now attempt a dissertation on
the physical meaning of coma. It is well known that
this condition may last for considerable periods, and
may at times, <i>even to the practised eye</i>, wear very much
the same aspect as death. In the present instance, its
association with some degree of convulsion may easily
have been mistaken by relatives, dreading the worst, for
the rigid stillness of <i>rigor mortis</i>. This is the more
likely, since the latter state is apt to be a transient one
in infants, though it is said to be unusually well marked
in death from convulsions. One cannot, however, help
thinking that the presence of the various signs of death
was not, in this case, very carefully inquired into. It is
hardly possible that, had the other proofs as well as that
of stiffening been sought for, they would have been
missed. <i>It is true that hardly any one sign short of
putrefaction can be relied upon as infallible.</i> In actual
death, however, one may confidently reckon on the
co-existence of more than one of these. After a period
of five days, not one should have been wanting. Besides
<i>rigor mortis</i>, the total absence of which, even in forms of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
death which are said not to show it, we take leave to
doubt, the <i>post-mortem</i> lividity of dependent parts afford
sure proof, as its absence suggests a doubt, of death.
Then there is the eye, sunken, with glairy surface, flaccid
cornea, and dilated insensitive pupil. Most practitioners,
probably, are accustomed to rely upon stethoscopic
evidence of heart-action or respiration. These alone,
indeed, are almost always sufficient to decide the question
of vitality, if they be watched for during one or
two minutes. There is no information as to whether
the child so nearly buried alive was seen by a medical
man. It is difficult to believe that, if it had been, some
sign of life would not have been observed. Still, the
case is a teaching one, even for medical men, and warns
us to look for a combination of known tests where any
doubt exists as to the fact of death.” The italics are
ours.</p>

<p>Prof. Alex. Wilder, M.D., in “Perils of Premature
Burial,” p. 20, says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote">DR. ALEXANDER WILDER’S OPINION.</div>

<p>“The signs of total extinction of life are not so unequivocal
as many suppose. Cessation of respiration
and circulation do not afford the entire evidence, for the
external senses are not sufficiently acute to enable us to
detect either respiration or circulation in the smallest
degree compatible with mere existence. Loss of heat
is by no means conclusive; for life may continue, and
recovery take place, when no perceptible vital warmth
exists.”</p>

<p>M. B. Gaubert, in “Les Chambres Mortuaires
d’Attente,” p. 187, Paris, 1895, says:&mdash;</p>

<p>“One of the most celebrated physicians of the Paris
hospitals, according to Dr. Lignières, declares that out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
of twenty certified deaths, one only presented indubitable
characteristics of absolute death.”</p>

<p>The difficulty of diagnosis in many cases being
allowed renders the obligation and necessity for a
radical change in our methods of treating the supposed
dead a very urgent one. Medical writers, whilst admitting
the unsatisfactory nature of the current practice of
medical certification, allege that the remedy lies with
Parliament to make compulsory a personal medical
inspection of the dead, and to allow a fee as compensation
for the trouble. This, however, would be very far
from meeting the difficulty. How many general practitioners
would be willing to submit half-a-dozen, say, of
the eleven tests of death formulated by Sir Benjamin
Ward Richardson, in any given case, and if willing, how
many, having regard to the fact that these tests are not
taught in the Medical Schools, and form no part of the
usual medical curriculum, would be competent to make
them with the requisite skill? In most of the Continental
States there are State-appointed surgeons to
examine the dead, <i>médécins vérificateurs</i>, and in some of
these&mdash;Würtemburg, for instance&mdash;the official is obliged
to examine the corpse several times before his certificate
is made out. But notwithstanding this careful official
inspection, cases of premature burial and narrow escapes
are telegraphed by <i>Reuter</i> and <i>Dalziel</i> every now and
then to the English Press, as we have seen, and
additional details, with the names and addresses of
the victims, are furnished by responsible special
correspondents.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CONFUSION OF MEDICAL OPINIONS.</div>

<p>The best proof that one can give of the uncertainty of
the signs of death is the great divergence of opinion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
amongst medical experts. Dr. Gannal, in “Signes de
la Mort,” Paris, 1890, p. 27, observes:&mdash;“If any of these
signs had presented characters of absolute certainty, it
is unquestionable that the unanimity of authors would
have recognised it; now, there is none. One sign
held to be good by some, is declared bad by others.”
Dr. Gannal affirms with iteration that there is only one
unequivocal sign and proof of dissolution&mdash;decomposition.
All authorities agree that whatever degree of
doubt attends the ordinary appearances of death, none
dispute that this amounts to a demonstration.</p>

<p>When standing round the bed of a sick patient,
reduced to a state of coma or suspended animation,
to which death is the expected termination, as soon
as the doctor utters the fatal words “all is over,” no
one present thinks of doubting the verdict, or putting
it to the test. Mr. Clarke Irvine, who has had a wide
experience, writing in the <i>Banner of Light</i>, December
14, 1895, Boston, U.S., says:&mdash;</p>

<p>“I have known of hundreds of deaths in my experience,
and never have I known of any instance
wherein a bystander has doubted save once, and then
the person supposed dead was revived, and is now living
out in Colorado. The mere accident of a stranger
coming in just previous to the enclosing in a coffin
prevented the man from the awful fate of burial alive,
so far as we can see.</p>

<p>“In one other, the supposed dead man came to life
a little before the time set for his funeral, by the
accident of some one seizing hold of his foot: he is
still living, and a resident of this country. The case
was widely published in the newspapers after he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
interviewed by a reporter in Chicago, where the rescued
man was visiting at the time of the great Fair. He is
known as Judge William Poynter. I saw him a few
days ago, and have heard him relate the experience.</p>

<p>“The case of the little girl who was rescued while
the funeral was in progress, at St. Joseph, Missouri, I
have already contributed to <i>The Banner</i>. These people
were saved by a mere chance; how many have passed
underground forever, of whom nothing was ever suspected!
All through the country, people are dying or
apparently dying, or falling into death-like trances daily,
and being placed in their coffins <i>as a matter of course</i>,
and hurried to and into their graves, <i>as of course</i> also&mdash;and
in the very nature of things it must be and must
have been that hundreds upon hundreds have been and
are being consigned to that most awful of all the dooms
possible. The horror of the thing is simply unspeakable.”</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="pc1">§ 4.</p>

<p>In public hospitals, penitentiaries, charitable or other similar
homes or institutions, the duty of inspection falls upon the
physician in chief.</p>

<p>Outside these institutions the inspectors must be chosen, in the
first instance, from among physicians, after them surgeons, former
assistants of military hospitals, and lastly, in default of such, from
lay people. The latter must, however, be of undoubted respectability,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
and, before their appointment, must be properly instructed
by the district physician, and subjected from time to time to an
examination.</p>

<p class="pc1">§ 6.</p>

<p>As a rule the inspection of dead bodies must be made once if
by doctors, and twice if by laymen. In communities which possess
a mortuary a <i>second inspection</i> has to be made, even though the
regular inspection has previously been made by doctors or laymen.</p>

<p class="pc1">§ 7.</p>

<p>The first inspection has to be made as soon as possible after
death, and, where practicable, within twenty-four hours, and in
cases described under § 6, sec. 2, at least before removal of the
body to the mortuary.</p>

<p>The second inspection must take place just before burial.</p>

<p class="pc1">§ 8.</p>

<p>The body, until the arrival of the Inspector, must be left in
an undisturbed position, with the face uncovered, and free from
closely-fitting garments.</p>

<p>The instructions of the Inspector, for the resuscitation of a
body suspected of apparent death only, are to be followed most
strictly.</p>

<p class="pc1">§ 9.</p>

<p>The Inspector has to give a certificate of corpse inspection
confirmatory of his inspection, but he must only issue the same if
he has fully ascertained the actuality of death.</p>

<p class="pc1">§ 10.</p>

<p>(1) As a rule the bodies must not be interred before the lapse of
48 hours, but not later than 72 hours, after death.</p>

<p>The Police Authorities may, however, at the recommendation of
the Corpse Inspector, exceptionally grant permission for the burial
before the expiration of 48 hours if a <i>post-mortem</i> dissection has
taken place, also if decomposition has set in, and if on account of
lack of room the body has to be preserved in an overcrowded
habitation.</p></div>

<p class="pind p1"><span class="smcap">Appendix</span> to the Police Instructions as to Corpse
Inspection and time of Burial, of 20th November,
1885.</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="pc1">I.</p>

<p>The purpose of corpse inspection is to prohibit the concealment
of deaths by violent means or resulting from medical malpractices;
to detect infectious diseases, and the establishment of correct death
lists; and particularly <i>to prevent the burial of people only apparently
dead</i>. For this purpose each corpse is to be closely examined
on the first inspection as to any signs of death, both in the front
and the back of the body.</p>

<p class="pc1">II.</p>

<p>The Inspectors have primarily to establish the actuality of death
by observing and notifying all the symptoms accompanying or
following the decease.</p>

<p>Indications of death may be noted:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) If there is no indication of any pulsation noticeable, either in
the region of the heart, at the neck, at the temples, or the forearm.</p>

<p>(2) If the eyelids when pulled asunder remain open, and the
eyes themselves appear sunken into their sockets, dulled, and
lustreless, also if the eyeballs feel soft and relaxed.</p>

<p>(3) If parts of the body are pale and cold, if chin and nose are
pointed, if cheeks and temples are sunken.</p>

<p>(4) If the lower jaw hangs down and immediately drops again
if pushed up, or if the muscles feel hard and stiff (rigidity).</p>

<p>(5) If the skin of the fingers held against one another, held
towards light, do not appear reddish.</p>

<p>(6) If a feather or burning candle held against the mouth show
no sign of motion, or if there is no sign of moisture upon a looking-glass
held before the mouth.</p>

<p>(7) If on different parts of the body, particularly the neck, back,
or posterior, or the undersurface of the extremities there are bluish-red
spots (death spots) visible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>(8) If the skin, particularly at the sides of the stomach, show a
dirty-green discoloration (decomposition spots).</p>

<p>The non-Medical Inspector has to observe at least all the
symptoms 1 to 4.</p>

<p>In doubtful cases the Medical Inspectors are advised to test the
muscles and nerves by electric currents.</p>

<p class="pc1">IV.</p>

<p>If the inspection gives rise to suspicions of apparent death
(Scheintod), the inspector must (if he is not himself a doctor)
immediately call for the assistance of a practised physician, so as
to establish the actual condition, and to adopt the necessary
measures for resuscitation, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) Opening of the windows, and warming the room.</p>

<p>(2) Efforts at artificial respiration.</p>

<p>(3) Applications of warm mustard-plaisters to the chest and the
extremities.</p>

<p>(4) Rubbing with soft brushes, with cloths saturated in vinegar,
or spirit of camphor, also with hot woollen cloths.</p>

<p>(5) Irritation of the throat with a feather.</p>

<p>(6) Smelling sal-ammoniac.</p>

<p>(7) Dropping from time to time a few drops of “extract of balm”
or similar essences into the mouth.</p>

<p>Unless medical aid has meanwhile arrived, the application of
these measures must be continued until the apparently dead comes,
back to life, and begins to swallow, in which case he ought to have
warm broth, tea, or wine, or until there is absolutely no doubt as
to the total ineffectiveness of all attempts at reanimation.</p></div>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

<p class="pch">DURATION OF DEATH-COUNTERFEITS.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> differences observed in the length of time that
persons have remained in this condition depended,
doubtless, upon the constitutional peculiarities of the
patients&mdash;such as strength or weakness&mdash;or upon the
nature of the disease from which they may have suffered.
Struve, in his Essay, pp. 34-98, says “that it depends
upon the proportion of vital power in the individual.
Hence children and young persons will endure longer
than the aged. Also upon the nature of the element in
which the accident happened, whether it contained
greater or less proportion of oxygenated or carbonic
acid gas, or other poisonous vapours. The latent vital
power seems to be much longer preserved when animation
has been suspended by cold. A man revived after
being under snow forty hours. Persons apparently dead
sometimes awake after an interval of seven days, as was
the case with Lady Russell.... In the female sex,
the suspension of vital power, spasms, fainting fits, etc.,
originating from a hysterical, feeble constitution, are not
rare, nor is it improbable that the state of apparent
death may be of longer duration with them; nay, it may
be looked upon as a periodical disorder, in which all
susceptibility of irritation is extinguished.” Struve
further remarks, p. 98, “that the state in which the vital<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
power is suspended, or in which there is a want of
susceptibility of stimuli, consists of infinite modifications,
from the momentary transient fainting fit, to a death-like
torpor of a day’s duration. The susceptibility of
irritation may be completely suppressed, and the
apparently dead may be insensible of the strongest
stimuli, such as the operation of the knife, and the
effects of a red-hot iron.”</p>

<p class="p1">The order of frequency of diseases in which these
occurred was as follows:&mdash;Asphyxia, hysteria, apoplexy,
narcotism, concussion of the brain, the cases of
concussion being the shortest.</p>

<p>The length of time a person may live in the grave
will depend upon similar concomitant conditions; but
all things considered, a person buried while in a state of
trance, catalepsy, asphyxia, narcotism, nervous shock,
etc., and in any of the other states that cause apparent
death without passing through a course of disease, and
that occur during his or her usual health, will have a
longer struggle before life becomes extinct than one whose
strength had been exhausted by an attack of sickness.
Estimates of the duration of such a struggle differ considerably.
Some writers believe that “however intense,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
it must be short-lived.” As to the prolongation of the
horrible suffering incident to such tragic occurrences,
Dr. Léonce Lénormand, in his “Des Inhumations
Précipitées,” pp. 2-4, observes&mdash;“It is a mistake to think
that a living person, enclosed in a narrow box, and
covered with several feet of earth, would succumb to
immediate asphyxiation.”<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>Dr. Charles Londe, in his “La Mort Apparent,”
remarks:&mdash;“It has been calculated that, after one
quarter of the quantity of atmospheric air contained in
the coffin&mdash;approximately estimated at one hundred
and twenty litres&mdash;was exhausted, death would set in;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
therefore, it is quite certain that, if the shroud is thick,
and the coffin well closed, and the grave impenetrable to
the atmosphere, life could not last more than forty to
sixty minutes after inhumation. But is not that a
century of torture?”</p>

<p>Some allowance should be made for the persistence of
the vital energy, which continues after all atmospheric
air is cut off. “Experiments on dogs show that the
average duration of the respiratory movements after the
animal has been deprived of air is four minutes five
seconds. The duration of the heart’s action is seven
minutes eleven seconds. The average of the heart’s
action after the animal has ceased to make respiratory
efforts is three minutes fifteen seconds. These experiments
further showed that a dog may be deprived of
air during three minutes fifty seconds, and afterwards
recover without the application of artificial means.”<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">PERSISTENCE OF LIFE.</div>

<p>Prof. P. Brouardel, M.D., Paris, in “La Morte Subité,”
p. 35, observes that:&mdash;“A dog, placed in a common
coffin, lived five to six hours; but a dog occupies less
room than a man, who, in such a coffin, when closed,
would not have more than one hundred litres, so he
would possibly live twenty minutes. I would not wish
anybody to pass twenty such cruel minutes.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Bernard, a skilful surgeon of Paris, certified that,
in the parish of Riol, he himself, and several other
bystanders, saw a monk of the Order of St. Francis, who
had been buried for three or four days, taken from his
grave breathing and alive, with his arms lacerated near<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
the swathes employed to secure them; but he died
immediately after his releasement. This gentleman
also asserts that a faithful narrative of so memorable
an accident was drawn up by public authority, and that
the raising of the body was occasioned by a letter written
from one of the monk’s friends, in which it was affirmed
that he was subject to paroxysms of catalepsy.”&mdash;<i>The
Uncertainty of the Signs of Death, by Surgeon M. Cooper.
Dublin, 1748.</i></p>

<p>In a volume, entitled “Information Relative to Persons
who have been Buried Alive,” by Heinrich Friedrich
Köppen, Halle, 1799, dedicated to Frederick William
III., King of Prussia, and Louise, Queen of Prussia,
are the nine following amongst many other cases:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“<i>England.</i>&mdash;Lady Russell, wife of a colonel in the army, was
considered dead, and only through the tender affection of her
husband was she saved from living burial. He would not allow
her to be taken away until decomposition would absolutely force
him to do so. After seven days, however, in the evening, when
the bells were ringing, the faithful husband had the triumph to see
her eyes open and her return to full consciousness.”</p>

<p>“<i>Halle, Germany.</i>&mdash;Medical Professor Junker, in Halle, a very
humane man, had a corpse of a suicide&mdash;by hanging&mdash;delivered
for dissection at his college. He was placed on a table in
the dissecting room, and covered with a cloth. About midnight,
while the professor was sitting at his writing-table in an adjoining
room, he heard a great noise in the dissecting room, and fearing
that cats were gnawing at the corpses, he went out, and saw the
cloth in a disturbed condition, and on lifting it up found the corpse
missing. As all the doors and windows were closed, he searched
the room, and found the missing one crouching in a corner,
trembling with cold, in the terror of death. He besought the
professor for mercy, help, and means for escape, as he was a
deserter from the army, and he would be severely punished if
caught. After consideration the kind professor clothed him, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
took him out of town at night as his own servant&mdash;passing the
guards&mdash;pretending to be on a professional visit, and set him free
in the country. Years afterwards he met the same man in Hamburg
as a prosperous merchant.”</p>

<p>“<i>Leipsic.</i>&mdash;The wife of the publisher, Mathäus Hornisch, died,
and, according to the custom of the times, the coffin was opened
before being put into the ground. The grave-digger noticed golden
rings on her fingers, and in the following night went to the grave
to steal them&mdash;which he found was not easy to do&mdash;when suddenly
she drew back her arm. The robber ran away frightened,
leaving his lantern at the grave. The woman recovered, but
could not make out where she was, and cried for help. No one
heard her; so she got out of the grave, took the lantern, and went
to her home. Knocking at the door, the servant called to know
who it was. She replied, “Your mistress. Open the door; I
am cold, and freezing to death.” The master was called; and
happily she was restored to her home again, where she lived for
several years longer.”</p>

<p>“<i>Pavese, Italy, 1787.</i>&mdash;A clergyman was buried, and noises were
heard in his grave afterwards. Upon opening the grave and the
coffin, the man was found alive, and violently trembling with fright.”</p>

<p>“<i>Paris, 1787.</i>&mdash;A carpenter was buried, noises were heard proceeding
from his grave, and upon opening it he was found to be
breathing. He was taken to his home, where he recovered.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">DR. KÖPPEN’S CASES.</div>

<p>“<i>Stadamhof, 1785.</i>&mdash;A young, healthy girl, on the way to a
wedding, had an apoplectic stroke, as it was thought, and fell as if
dead. The following day she was buried. The grave-digger, who
was occupied near her grave that night, heard noises in it, and
being superstitious ran home in fright. The following morning
he returned to finish a grave he was digging, and heard the
whining again from the girl’s grave. He called for help, the grave
was opened, when they found the girl turned over, her face
scratched and bloody, her fingers bitten, and her mouth full of
blood. She was dead, with evidences of most dreadful suffering.”</p>

<p>“<i>France.</i>&mdash;Madame Lacour died after a long sickness, and was
buried in a vault of a church, with all her jewels on. Her maid
and the sexton opened the coffin the following night to steal the
jewellery, when some hot wax from the candle they were using<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
fell on the woman’s face and woke her up. The robbers fled in
fright, and the woman went back to her home. She lived many
years afterwards, and had a son who became a priest, who in
turn&mdash;inheriting his mother’s nature&mdash;underwent a fate similar to
her own.”</p>

<p>“<i>Lyons, France.</i>&mdash;The wife of a merchant died. Two days after
her seeming death, and just before the time set for her burial,
her husband, who, it seems, had some doubts as to her death, had
her taken from the coffin, and had a scarifier used in cupping
applied in twenty-five places without bringing any blood, but the
twenty-sixth application brought her to consciousness with a
scream, and she recovered completely.”</p>

<p>“<i>Cadillac.</i>&mdash;A woman had been buried in the morning. In the
following morning whining was heard in her grave. It was opened,
and the woman was found still alive, but she had mutilated half of
her right arm and the whole hand. She was finally restored.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">The <i>Spectator</i>, October 11, 1895, publishes particulars
of a recent case of recovery, after three days’ interment,
in Ireland. See pp. 111, 112 in this volume.</p>

<p>Köppen’s investigations led him to observe that&mdash;“Human
life may appear to come to a stop, and no one
can say it will not go on again, if time enough is allowed
for it to do so. This even the most learned in medicine
cannot explain away or deny; and the greatest precaution
should be taken before death is declared to exist.”</p>

<p class="pch">THE TREATMENT OF THE DEAD.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> following extracts from French, English, and
American authorities, who have made the subject of premature
burial one of patient research, show how the dead,
or apparently dead, were treated in their respective
countries at the time they wrote, and when no reforms had
been instituted. Buffon, who wrote more than a century
ago, said:&mdash;“Life often very nearly resembles death.
Neither ten, nor twenty, nor twenty-four hours are sufficient
to distinguish real from apparent death. There are
instances of persons who have been alive in the grave at
the end of the second, and even the third day. Why,
then, suffer to be interred so soon those whose lives we
ardently wished to prolong? Most savages pay more
attention to deceased friends and relatives, and regard
as the first duty what is but a ceremony with us.
Savages respect their dead, clothe them, speak to them,
recite their exploits, extol their virtues; while we, who
pique ourselves on our feelings, do not show common
humanity; we forsake and fly from our dead. We
have neither courage to look upon or speak to
them; we avoid every place which can recall their
memory.”</p>

<p>In his “History of the Modes of Interment among
Different Nations,” pp. 191-193, Mr. G. A. Walker,
surgeon, quotes the following observations, as deserving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
consideration on the subject of premature interment:&mdash;“On
many occasions, in all places, too much precipitation
attends this last office; or, if not precipitation, a neglect
of due precautions in regard to the body in general;
indeed, the most improper treatment that can be
imagined is adopted, and many a person is made to
descend into the grave before he has sighed his last
breath. Ancient and modern authors leave us no doubt
respecting the dangers or misconduct of such precipitation.
It must appear astonishing that the attention of
mankind has been, after all, so little aroused by an idea the
most terrible that can be conceived on this side eternity.
According to present usage, as soon as the semblance
of death appears, the chamber of the sick is deserted by
friends, relatives, and physicians; and the apparently
dead, though frequently living, body is committed to
the management of an ignorant and unfeeling nurse,
whose care extends no further than laying the limbs
straight, and securing her accustomed perquisites. The
bed-clothes are immediately removed, and the body is
exposed to the air. This, when cold, must extinguish
any spark of life that may remain, and which, by a
different treatment, might have been kindled into flame;
or it may only continue to repress it, and the unhappy
person afterwards revive amidst the horrors of the
tomb.</p>

<p>“The difference between the end of a weak life and
the commencement of death is so small, and the uncertainty
of the signs of the latter is so well established,
that we can scarcely suppose undertakers capable of
distinguishing an apparent from a real death. Animals
which sleep in the winter show no signs of life. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
this case, circulation is only suspended; but were it
annihilated, the vital spark does not so easily lose its action
as the fluids of the body, and the principle of life, which
long survives the appearance of death, may re-animate a
body in which the action of all the organs seems to be
at an end. But how difficult it is to determine whether
this principle may not be revived.... Coldness,
heaviness of the body, a leaden, livid colour, with a
yellowness in the visage, are all very uncertain signs.
M. Zimmermann observed them all upon the body of a
criminal, who fainted through dread of that punishment
which he had merited. He was shaken, dragged about,
and turned in the same manner as dead bodies are,
without the least signs of resistance, and yet, at the end
of twenty-four hours, he was recalled to life by means of
the volatile alkali.” Mr. Walker’s history was written
nearly sixty years ago, but the custom he deprecates
still continues.</p>

<div class="sidenote">IN THE UNITED STATES.</div>

<p>Dr. Moore Russell Fletcher, in his “Suspended Animation
and Restoration,” Boston, 1890, p. 19, speaking
of the treatment of the dead in the United States,
says:&mdash;“It is doubtful whether modern civilisation has
much advanced the rites of burial, or the means of
preventing interment before positive death. The practice
now is, as soon as apparent death takes place, to
begin at once preparing the body for burial; the
relatives and physician desert the room, pack it in ice or
open the windows, thus banishing any possible chance
of reviving or resuscitating any spark of vitality which
may exist. No examination is ever made by the
physician or the friends to see if there are even the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
faintest signs of life present. Under such circumstances,
and with no attempts made at discovering
whether any signs of life were still present (but a hasty
burial instead), it is not strange that cases of premature
interment frequently occur.”</p>

<p>The Rev. Walter Whiter, in his “Dissertation on the
Disorder of Death,” 1819, p. 328, sensibly observes:&mdash;“The
signs marked on the dying and the dead are
fallacious. The dying man may be the sinking man,
exhausted by his malady, or perhaps exhausting his
malady, and fainting under the conflict. Exert all the
arts which you possess, and which have been found not
only able to resuscitate and restore the dying, but even
the dead; rouse him from this perilous condition, and
suffer him not, by your supineness and neglect, to pass
into a state of putrefactive death.” And in p. 363:&mdash;“If
the humane societies had applied the same methods
in various cases of natural death which they have
adopted in the case of drowning, and if they had
obtained a similar success in the cultivation of their
art, the gloom of the bed of death would be brightened
with cheering prospects, and would have become the
bed of restoration and the scene of hope.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">AN OPENING FOR THE PROFESSION.</div>

<p>In this connection we may remark that no profession
is more overcrowded at the present time than that of
medicine, particularly in the United Kingdom, the
English Colonies, and the United States. Hundreds
of young men graduate from medical colleges every
year, vainly seeking openings for a practice; and some,
for the purpose of gaining a livelihood, resort to
expedients which the <i>Lancet</i> denounces as undignified,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
unprofessional, and disgraceful.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> Then, again, the
number of nurses and of those qualifying for this
honourable vocation is already in excess of the
demand, and nursing institutions under the keen competition
to which they are subjected, are reducing their
charges. Now, the care and treatment of the supposed
dead is an honourable vocation, offering a wide field for
the instructed physician and the tender and sympathetic
nurse, and if the appliances for resuscitation were always
at hand, as they should be, in every hospital, town-hall,
mortuary, police station, and in all large hotels and
churches, many lives now subjected to the risks of
premature burial would be saved. While in London
there are two or more houses or retreats for the
dying, there is no place for the apparently dead but
a shunned and neglected coffin. The time is not far
distant when the present mode of treating the dead
and the apparently dead&mdash;a practice born of superstition
and fear, by which many are consigned to
premature graves&mdash;will be catalogued amongst the
barbarisms of the nineteenth century.</p>

<p class="pch">NUMBER OF CASES OF PREMATURE BURIAL.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Those</span> interested in the movement, if we are right in
designating the widespread feeling of discontent by this
name, are occasionally asked if the cases of premature
burial are numerous, and what estimates, if any, have
been made of them. We have no means of answering
these queries. We do not even know the percentage of
people who are subject to trance, catalepsy, shocks,
stroke of lightning, syncope, exhausting lethargy, excessive
opium-eating, or other diseases or conditions which
produce the various death-counterfeits. Personal inquiries
over a considerable portion of Europe, America,
and the East prove that such cases are by no means of
infrequent occurrence, and this is the deliberate conclusion
of nearly all the authorities cited in this volume.</p>

<p>Dr. Chambers wrote in 1787&mdash;“Every age and country
affords instances of surprising recoveries, after lying
long for dead. From the number of those preserved by
lucky accidents, we may conclude a far greater number
might have been preserved by timely pains and skill.”&mdash;<i>Cited
in Mort Apparente et Mort Réelle, p. 17.</i></p>

<p>In his introduction to the work above cited, “Information
Relative to Persons who have been Buried Alive,” by
Henrich Friedrich Köppen, Halle, 1799, the author
says:&mdash;“General Staff Medical Officer, D. O. in D., states
that, in his opinion, one third of mankind are buried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
alive.” This estimate is very obviously exaggerated,
although many trustworthy experiences prove that a
certain number of those who die have returned to consciousness
in their graves. A great many are buried
alive from ignorance of their relatives, who mistake
coldness of the body, stoppage of the pulse and breathing,
the colour of death, spots of discolouration, a
certain odour, and stiffness of the limbs&mdash;which are
only deceptive signs, not the signs of real death.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DR. HUFELAND’S ADVICE.</div>

<p>The very respectable Dr. Hufeland says:&mdash;“One cannot
be too careful in deciding as to life or death, therefore I
always advise a delay of the funeral as long as possible,
so as to make all certain as to death. No wonder when
those who are buried alive, and who undergo indescribable
torture, condemn those who have been dearest to
them in life. They will have to undergo slow suffocation,
in furious despair, while scratching their flesh to
pieces, biting their tongues, and smashing their heads
against their narrow houses that confine them, and
calling to their best friends, and cursing them as murderers.
The dead should not be buried before the
fourth day; we even have examples that prove that
eight days or a fortnight is too soon&mdash;as there have
been revivals as late as that. I say every one should
respect those who only seem to be dead. They should
be treated gently, and kept in a warm bed for thirty-six
hours.”</p>

<p>Mr. John Snart, in his “Thesaurus,” pp. 27, 28, London,
1817, says:&mdash;“The number of dreadful catastrophes,
arising from premature interment, ...
that have been <i>discovered</i> only, or have transpired to
man, <i>above ground</i>, both in ancient and modern times,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
conveys to every reflecting mind the fearful thought
that they are but a <i>sample</i> (per synecdochen) out of such
an incalculable host, perhaps one in a thousand.”</p>

<p>Professor Froriép, quoted in Kempner’s volume, says
that&mdash;“In 1829, arrangements were made at the cemetery,
New York, so as to bury the corpses in such
manner as not to prevent them communicating with the
outside world, in case any should have awakened to
life; and among twelve hundred persons buried six
came to life again.” In Holland, the same author states,
of a thousand cases investigated, five came to life before
burial or at the grave. The Rev. J. G. Ouseley, in his
pamphlet on “Earth to Earth Burial,” London, 1895,
estimates “that two thousand seven hundred persons at
least, in England and Wales, are yearly consigned to a
living death, the most horrible conceivable.”</p>

<p>The Rev. Walter Whiter, in the “Disorder of Death,”
1819, p. 362, calls attention to one of the reports (of
Humane Societies) where the following passage occurs:
“Monsieur Thieurey, Doctor Regent of the Faculty
of Paris, is of opinion that one third, or perhaps half, of
those who die in their beds are not actually dead when
they are buried. He does not mean to say that so great
a number would be restored to life. In the intermediate
state, which reaches from the instant of apparent death
to that of total extinction of life, the body is not
insensible to the treatment it receives, though unable to
give any signs of sensibility.”</p>

<p>Maximilian Misson, in his “Voyage Through Italy,”
vol. i., letter 5, tells us “that the number of persons who
have been interred as dead, when they were really alive,
is very great, in comparison with those who have been,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
happily, rescued from their graves.” He then proceeds
to substantiate his statement by the recital of cases.</p>

<div class="sidenote">VARIOUS ESTIMATES.</div>

<p>Dr. Léonce Lénormand, in his able treatise, “Des
Inhumations Précipitées,” has given his deliberate
opinion that a thousandth part of the human race have
been, and are, for want of knowledge, annually buried
alive. This we regard as an under, rather than an overestimate.</p>

<p>M. Le Guern, in his “Danger des Inhumations
Précipitées,” which has passed through several editions,
declares that he has personally met with forty-six cases
of premature burial in twelve years. He devoted thirty
years to the study of the facts, and collected a list of
two thousand three hundred and thirteen cases from
various sources. He estimates the number of premature
burials in France at two per thousand.</p>

<p>On February 27, 1866, the petition of M. Cornot was
presented to the French Senate by M. de la Gueronnière,
stating that a comparatively large number of persons
are annually buried alive, which he supported by
statistics. The author has tried to procure a copy of
this petition, but these documents are not published by
the State department.</p>

<p>The following appears in the <i>Lancet</i>, June 14, 1884,
p. 1104:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="pc1">“BURIED ALIVE.</p>

<p>“Sir,&mdash;That this is an incident that does happen, and
frequently has happened, has for some years past been
my firm conviction; and during epidemics, particularly
in the East, its possible contingency has frequently
caused me much anxiety; and when the burial has, for
sanitary reasons, had to be very hurried, I always made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
it a rule to withhold my certificate unless I had personally
inspected the body and assured myself of the
fact of death.</p>

<p>“The reason and necessity for extreme caution in
such matters were impressed vividly upon me some
years ago, when visiting the crypt of the cathedral at
Bordeaux, where two bodies were shown, to whom, I
think it obvious, this most terrible of all occurrences
must have happened; and I am unable to attribute the
position in which they were found in their coffins, and
the look of horror which their faces still displayed, to
any action of <i>rigor mortis</i> or any other <i>post-mortem</i>
change, but simply and solely to their having awakened
to a full appreciation of their most awful position. In
the case of one of these bodies, which was found lying
on its side, the legs were drawn up nearly to a level
with the abdomen, and the arms were in such a position
as to convey the impression that both they and the legs
had been used in a desperate, but futile, attempt to
push out the side of the coffin; whilst the look of horror
remaining on the face was simply indescribable. In the
other case, the body was found lying on its face, the
arms extended above the head, as if attempting to push
out the top of the coffin. In the year 1870 these two
bodies were still on view; and the attendants used to
dwell at some length upon the horrors of being interred
alive. It appears that some years prior to 1870, in
making excavations in a church-yard in the immediate
vicinity of the cathedral, the workmen came upon a belt
of ground that apparently was impregnated with some
antiseptic material, as all the bodies within this belt, to
the number of about two hundred, were found to be almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
as perfect as when they were buried; of these a selection
appears to have been made; and at the time I mention
about thirty or forty were exhibited, propped up on iron
frames, in the crypt of the cathedral. The impression
left on my mind at the time was that; if out of two
hundred bodies so discovered there could be two in
which, to say the least, there is a strong probability of
live interment, this awful possibility was a thing that
should receive more attention than is generally devoted
to it.&mdash;I am, Sir, your obedient servant,</p>

<p class="pr2">“H. S.</p>

<p>“Bayswater, June 10, 1884.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">Protests against the present state of the law in France
are very frequent. M. Gaubert in “Les Chambres
Mortuaires d’Attente,” page 80, says: “During the
monarchy of July petitions have not ceased to come in
from all parts of France to the Chamber of Deputies.”
<span class="sidenote">PROTESTS OF GENERAL COUNCILS.</span>For a great number of years, said the Deputy Varin,
in the sitting of April 10, 1847, every year petitions
having the same object (the prevention of premature
burial) are presented to the Chambers and referred to
the Ministry. What has been done, however? Nothing!
Again M. Gaubert in p. 88, referring to resolutions of the
General Councils of the Departments, observes: “That
under the movement of protest, which we are examining
and find particularly serious, is shown the widespread
character which it assumes. It is, indeed, from all parts
of France, and under every form, that the sad complaints
of the public (for the prevention of premature
burial) arrive at the office of the Minister of the Interior.
Those protests adopted by the General Councils (of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
Departments) were not the less numerous nor the less
conspicuous in important places. Many of those who
take the trouble to petition or draw up resolutions have
been prompted to action by melancholy experience of
such catastrophes in their own families.”</p>

<p>M. Gaubert in “Les Chambres Mortuaires d’Attente”
(Paris, 1895), pp. 193-195, says that in France there are
in round numbers thirty-six thousand Communes, and
it is beyond doubt that in every one of these will be
found cases of premature burial. Communes with a population
of eight hundred have even several. Dr. Pineau has
recorded twelve in the single Commune of Fontenay-le-Comte
in Poitou. In the large towns, especially in those
which have great hospitals, the proportion is more considerable.
In Paris, Dr. Rousseau, verificateur of the
dead, in 1853 wrote: “Le médecin n’est jamais appelé
que pour constater la mort apparente.” M. Gaubert
declares that he would not be far from the truth in estimating
the number of victims to apparent death at eight
thousand a year, and asks if France be so rich in population
as to be able to pay such an enormous tribute. Dr.
Josat, lauréat de l’Institut, declares that a considerable
number of people refuse to visit France through fear
that they might be overtaken by apparent death and
precipitately buried alive.</p>

<p>The <i>Undertakers’ Journal</i>, July 22, 1889, the editor
of which has exceptional opportunities of knowing the
true facts, observes: “It has been proved beyond all
contradiction that there are more burials alive than is
generally supposed. Stories of these cases are numerous.
Five cases are reported on p. 85 of this same
issue, one the wife of a well-known tradesman at St.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
Leonards, medically pronounced dead, but who revived
before it was too late. Many undertakers could
describe similar experiences.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">OPINIONS OF DRS. CHEW AND HARTMANN.</div>

<p>Dr. Roger S. Chew, of Calcutta, in reply to the
author’s inquiries while in India in the early part of the
year (1896) says: “There are hundreds of instances on
record where from some cause, as syncope, shock,
chloroform, hysteria, or other condition not clearly
understood, the powers of life assumed a static condition
in which oxidation was completely arrested,
carbonification was held in abeyance, and nitrification
maintained at positive rest, with the consequence that
the vital functions have passed into a condition of
hibernation or apparent death so closely simulating
real or absolute death as to render differential diagnosis
an almost impossibility, and to lead to the interment
or cremation while yet alive of a body apparently
dead.”</p>

<p>Dr. Franz Hartmann, of Hallein, Austria, whose
book, “Buried Alive,” is now being translated into
French, has collected seven hundred cases of premature
burial and narrow escapes, several of which have occurred
in his own neighbourhood, and is of opinion that
the actual danger to every member of the human
family is of serious proportions, and that the subject
should not be trifled with. He is a strong advocate
for cremation as offering the easiest practical method of
prevention.</p>

<p>It will have been noticed that whenever the subject
of premature burial has been introduced in an influential
journal published in England, the United States, or the
Continent, one contribution follows another in quick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
succession, by persons furnishing particulars of cases of
trance, catalepsy, and of narrow escapes from living
burial. The Paris <i>Figaro</i> opened its columns two years
ago for this subject, and in fifteen days received four
hundred letters from all parts of France. When we
consider that nearly all the reported cases of resuscitation
have come about spontaneously and independently
of human intervention, it becomes evident, owing to our
ignorance and apathy, that cases of premature burial
are far from infrequent, and our church-yards and
cemeteries, like those examined by Dr. Thouret in
Paris, are probably the silent witnesses of unnumbered
unspeakable tragedies. Immediate legislation is called
for to remedy a national evil, and to remove the feeling
of disquietude which extensively prevails.</p>

<p class="pch">EMBALMING AND DISSECTIONS.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">An</span> intelligent and observing correspondent writes to
the author that “under the prevailing custom of embalming
in vogue in the United States, it is almost
impossible to have a living burial, as the injection of
the fluids used in the operation would prevent revival
and make death certain. Of course, the class denominated
‘poor folks,’ who cannot afford this security,
have to take their chances with the mysteries of trance
and other forms of apparent death, as well as with
ignorance, indifference, and unseemly haste, that seem
to encompass a man at a time when he is in need of
the most considerate care.”</p>

<p>Embalming is no doubt preferable, as was thought
by the late Lady Burton, to the risks, prevailing in
almost all countries, of burial before careful medical
examination, for the reason that it is better to be killed
outright by the embalmer’s poisonous injections, or even
to come to life under the scalpel of the anatomist, than
to recover underground. A leading New York investigator
has openly declared his belief that a considerable
number of human beings (supposed by their relatives to
be dead, but who are really only in a state of death
trance) are annually killed in America by the embalming
process.</p>

<p class="psh">EMBALMING.</p>

<p>In the second edition of Dr. Curry’s “Observations
on Apparent Death,” 1815, p. 105, the case is cited of
William, Earl of Pembroke, who died April 10, 1630.
When the body was opened in order to be embalmed,
he was observed, immediately after the incision was
made, to lift up his hand.</p>

<p>F. Kempner, in “Denkschrift,” p. 6, says:&mdash;</p>

<p class="p1">“Owing to some great mental excitement, the Cardinal Spinosa
fell into a state of apparent death. He was declared to be dead

purpose of embalming his body. When the lungs were laid open,
the heart began to beat again; the cardinal returned to consciousness,
and was just able to grasp the knife of the surgeon when he
fell back and died in reality.”<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p></div>

<p class="p1">“Cardinal Somaglia was seized with a severe illness, from
extreme grief; he fell into a state of syncope, which lasted so long
that the persons around him thought him dead. Preparations
were instantly made to embalm his body, before the putrefactive
process should commence, in order that he might be placed in a
leaden coffin, in the family vault. The operator had scarcely
penetrated into his chest when the heart was seen to beat. The
unfortunate patient, who was returning to his senses at that
moment, had still sufficient strength to push away the knife of
the surgeon, but too late, for the lung had been mortally wounded,
and the patient died in a most lamentable manner.”</p></div>

<p class="pc1">“MRS. BISHOP’S EXPERIENCE.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Eleanor Fletcher Bishop, the mother of the celebrated mind-reader,
has a thrilling experience of her own regarding the horrors of
being railroaded into the grave. Anent the unseemly haste exercised
by the doctors who made the autopsy on her son, the old lady stated
what terrible perils she at one time barely escaped. ‘I am subject
to the same cataleptic trances in which my boy often fell,’ said
Mrs. Bishop. ‘One can see and hear everything, but speech and
movement are paralyzed. It is horrible. For six days, some years
ago, I was in a trance, and saw arrangements being made for my
funeral. Only my brother’s determined resistance prevented them
from embalming me, and I lay there and heard it all. On the
seventh day I came to myself, but the agony I endured left its
mark forever.’”</p></div>

<p class="p1">Dr. P. J. Gibbons, M.A., says:&mdash;</p>

<p class="p1">“In my mind there is no doubt that bodies in which
life is not extinct are embalmed. To prevent the embalming
of live bodies in cases where doubt exists, my
method for resuscitation should be resorted to. If
success does not follow, death has taken place. When
one in whom the vital spark may possibly not yet have
fled is found, two objects should be aimed at, viz., first,
to restore breathing, and, second, to promote warmth
and circulation.”&mdash;<i>The Casket</i>, Rochester, New York,

<p>The Select Committee of the House of Commons
appointed in 1893 to enquire into the subject of Death<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
Certification, suggests in their report that in all cases
where it is desired to embalm a dead body an authorisation
should be obtained from the Home Secretary.
This is probably intended to prevent concealing cases
of death by poisoning. The Select Committee might
very well have extended its recommendations to the
need of verifying the death before the embalmer was
allowed to exercise his art on the subject. Legislation
in the United States, where embalming is extensively
practised among well-to-do people, is a matter of urgent
necessity. The author is aware of only one town where
the city ordinance enforces such verification before
permitting burial.</p>

<p>Mr. M. Cooper, surgeon, in his admirable little volume
“The Uncertainty of the Signs of Death,” London,
1746, p. 196, observes that “those who are dissected
run no risk of being interred alive. The operation is an
infallible means to secure them from so terrible a fate.
This is one advantage which persons dissected have
over those who are, without any further ceremony, shut
up in their coffins.”</p>

October, 1840, a servant girl, who had retired to bed
apparently in perfect health, was found the following
morning, as it appeared, dead. A surgeon who was
called pronounced her to have been dead for some
hours. A coroner’s inquest was summoned for four
o’clock, and the reporter and the surgeon who had been
called in to the girl were ordered to inspect the body
previous to its sitting. On proceeding to the house for
this purpose at two o’clock, the inspectors found the girl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
lying in bed in an easy posture, her face pallid, but
placid and composed, as if she were in a deep sleep,
while the heat of the body had not diminished. A vein
was opened by them, and various stimuli applied, but
without affording any sign of resuscitation. After two
hours of hesitation and delay, a message being brought
that the jury were waiting for their evidence, they were
forced to proceed to the inspection. In moving the
body for this purpose, the warmth and pliancy of the
limbs were such as to give the examiners the idea that
they had to deal with a living subject! The internal
cavities, as they proceeded, were found so warm that a
very copious steam issued from them on exposure. All
the viscera were in a healthy state, and nothing was
detected which could throw the smallest light on the
cause of this person’s death.” Tidy (<i>Legal Medicine</i>),
part i., p. 140, remarks thereon&mdash;“A mistake had no
doubt been made in this case, as its warmth was not
caused by decomposition.”</p>

<p>In the <i>Cyclopædia of Practical Medicine</i>, edited by
Sir John Forbes, M.D., and others, 1847, vol. i.,
pp. 548-9, we find the following:&mdash;“Nothing is more
certain than death; nothing is more uncertain at times
than its reality; and numerous instances are recorded
of persons prematurely buried, or actually at the verge
of the grave before it was discovered that life still
remained; and even of some who were resuscitated by
the knife of the anatomist.... Bruhier, a celebrated
French physician, who wrote on the uncertainties
of the signs of death in 1742, relates an instance of a
young woman upon whose supposed corpse an anatomical
examination was about to be made when the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
stroke of the scalpel revealed the truth; she recovered,
and lived many years afterwards. The case related by
Philippe Pue is somewhat similar. He proceeded to
perform the Cæsarean section upon a woman who had
to all appearance died undelivered, when the first incision
betrayed the awful fallacy under which he acted....
‘There is scarcely a dissecting-room that has not some
traditional story handed down of subjects restored to
life after being deposited within its walls. Many of
these are mere inventions to catch the ever greedy ear
of curiosity; but some of them are, we fear, too well
founded to admit of much doubt. To this class belongs
the circumstance related by Louis, the celebrated French
writer on medical jurisprudence. A patient who was
supposed to have died in the Hospital Salpétrière was
removed to his dissecting-room. Next morning Louis
was informed that moans had been heard in the theatre;
and on proceeding thither he found to his horror that
the supposed corpse had revived during the night, and
had actually died in the struggle to disengage himself
from the winding sheet in which he was enveloped.
This was evident from the distorted attitude in which
the body was found. Allowing for much of the fiction
with which such a subject must ever be mixed, there is
still sufficient evidence to warrant a diligent examination
of the means of discriminating between real and apparent
death; indeed, the horror with which we contemplate a
mistake of the living for the dead should excite us to
the pursuit of knowledge by which an event so repugnant
to our feelings may be avoided.... If life
depends upon the presence of a force or power continually
opposed to the action of physical and chemical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
laws, real death will be the loss of this force, and the
abandonment of organised bodies to these agents;
while apparent death will be only the suspension of the
exercise of life, caused by some derangement of the
functions which serve as instruments of vital action. This
suspension must have been lost for a considerable time, if
we may judge by the cases collected by credible authors,
to some of which we have alluded, and by the numerous
instances of drowned persons restored to life after long
submersion. From this definition of life and death, it
would follow that putrefaction is the only evidence of
real death.’ ... The absence of the circulation of
the blood has been looked upon as a certain indication
of death; but this test is not much to be depended on,
for it is well known that persons may live even for hours
in whom no trace of the action of the heart and arteries
can be perceived.”</p>

<p>Le Guern, in “Du Danger Des Inhumations Précipitées,”
chap. iv., p. 24, relates that “The Abbé Prévost
was found in the forest of Chantilly perfectly insensible.
They thought him dead. A surgeon proceeded to
make a <i>post-mortem</i>; but hardly had he put the scalpel
in the body of the unfortunate victim before the supposed
corpse uttered a cry, and the surgeon realised the
mistake he had made. Prévost only became conscious
to feel aware of the horror of the death by which he
perished.”</p>

<p>Dr. Franz Hartmann, in his “Premature Burial,” p. 80,
has the following:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“In May, 1864, a man died very suddenly at a hospital in the
State of New York, and, as the doctors could not explain the cause
of death, they resolved upon a <i>post-mortem</i> examination, but, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
they made the first cut with the knife, the supposed dead man
jumped up and grasped the doctor’s throat. The doctor was
terrified and died of apoplexy on the spot, but the “dead” man
recovered fully.</p>

<p class="p1">Brigade-Surgeon W. Curran in his 8th paper, entitled
“Buried Alive,” relates the following:&mdash;“At the Medical
College at Calcutta, on the 1st of February, 1861,” so
writes my friend as above, “the body of a Hindu male,
about 25 years of age, was brought from the police
hospital for dissection.... It was brought to the
dissecting-room about 6 a.m., and the arteries were
injected with arsenical solution about 7. At 11 the
prosector opened the thorax and abdomen for the
purpose of dissecting the sympathetic nerve. At noon
Mr. Macnamara distinctly saw the heart beating; there
was a regular rythmical vermicular action of the right
auricle and ventricle. The pericardium was open, the
heart being freely exposed, and lying to the left in its
natural position. The heart’s action, although regular,
was very weak and slow. The left auricle was also in
action, but the left ventricle was contracted and rigid,
and apparently motionless. These spontaneous contractions
continued till about 12.45 p.m., and, further,
the right side of this organ contracted on the application
of a stimulus, such as the point of a scalpel, &amp;c., for
a quarter of an hour longer.”&mdash;<i>Health</i>, May 21st, 1886,
p. 121.</p>

<p>Bruhier in his work, “Dissertation sur l’Incertitude
de la Mort et l’Abus des Enterrements,” records a
number of cases of the supposed dead who, after burial,
were revived at the dissecting table, together with fifty-three
that awoke in their coffins before being buried,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
fifty-two persons actually buried alive, and seventy-two
other cases of apparent death. This was at a time
when body-snatching was in vogue, and it is a curious
comment on our civilisation to be compelled to admit
that a subject of trance or catalepsy during the last or the
early part of the present century had a better chance of
escape from so terrible a fate than now, when the vocation
of the resurrection-man has become obsolete.</p>

<p class="pch">DEATH-CERTIFICATION.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A Select Committee</span> of the House of Commons, under
the chairmanship of Sir Walter Foster, M.D., was
appointed on March 27, 1893, to inquire into the subject
of death-certification in the United Kingdom. Fourteen
sittings were held, and thirty-two witnesses examined.
All the witnesses practically agreed as to the
serious defects in the law, and a number of recommendations
were made. It was shown that in about four per
cent. of the cases the cause of death was ill-defined and
unspecified, many practitioners having forms specially
printed for their own use, in which all mention of medical
attendance is omitted, the object being to enable the
doctor to give certificates in cases which he has never
attended. Numerous deaths attended by unqualified
practitioners were certified by qualified practitioners
who had probably never seen the cases; and deaths were
certified by medical practitioners who had not seen the
patient for weeks or months prior to death, and who
knew only by hearsay of the deaths having occurred.
Deaths were also certified in which the true cause was suppressed
in deference to the feelings of survivors; these
last in particular are reported to be very numerous.</p>

<div class="sidenote">INADEQUATE RECOMMENDATIONS.</div>

<p>In Q. 2552-83, remarkable evidence was produced as
to the reckless mode of death-certification. One medical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
witness testified that he saw a certificate of death, signed
by a registered medical practitioner, giving both the fact
and the cause of death of a man who was actually alive
at the time, and who lived four days afterwards, with
facts of even a more startling character described as
“murder made easy.” It was pointed out that fraud
and irregularity in giving false declarations of death are
by no means infrequent. Various other matters are
treated, and the following are some of their recommendations:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">1. That in no case should a death be registered without the
production of a certificate of the cause of death by a registered
medical practitioner, or by a coroner after inquest, or, in Scotland,
by a procurator-fiscal.</p>

<p>2. That in each sanitary district a registered medical practitioner
should be appointed as public medical certifier of the cause of death
in cases in which a certificate from a medical practitioner in attendance
was not forthcoming.</p>

<p>3. That a medical practitioner in attendance should be required,
before giving a certificate of death, to personally inspect the body,
but if, on the ground of distance, or for other sufficient reason, he
is unable to make this inspection himself, he should obtain and
attach to the certificate of the cause of death a certificate signed
by two persons, neighbours, verifying the fact of death.</p>

<p>4. That medical practitioners be required to send certificates
of death direct to the registrar instead of handing them to the
relatives of the deceased.</p>

<p>5. That a form of certificate of death should be prescribed, and
that medical practitioners should be required to use such form.</p></div>

<p class="p1">From the <i>Times</i>, May 23, 1896:&mdash;</p>


<div class="pbq">

<p class="pc1">DEATH-CERTIFICATION.</p>

<p>At the special meeting of the Metropolitan Counties Branch of
the British Medical Association, held last night at the Museum of
Practical Geology, Jermyn Street, the subject of an improvement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
in the present procedure in death-certification and registration
came up for discussion. Sir W. Priestley, M.P., president, took
the chair.</p>

<p>Sir Henry Thompson moved the following resolution:&mdash;“Considering
that a Select Committee of the House of Commons has
in 1893 made an extended inquiry into the subject of death-certification
and registration on the plan now followed in this
country, and has reported that it manifestly fails to accomplish the
purpose for which it was designed, this meeting is of opinion that
Her Majesty’s Government should be respectfully memorialised to
bring in a bill as soon as possible to give effect to an improved
procedure in general accordance with the suggestions offered in
the Committee’s report.” He said that, during the last twenty
years or more, circumstances had not unfrequently occurred to
attract public attention to the existence of grave defects in the
system of death-certification adopted in this country, whether
regarded as a safeguard against criminal attempts on life, or as a
means of forming trustworthy records of disease for scientific purposes.
From the Registrar-General’s report for England and Wales
for the year 1892, it was shown that in fifteen thousand cases of death
no inquiry had been made as to its cause, and that no certificate had
been obtained from any source&mdash;a number amounting to nearly three
per cent. on the total returned for the year. On the same authority
it appeared that in twenty-five thousand more, or four and a half
per cent., the cases “were so inadequately certified as not to be
classifiable,” making together a class of seven and a half per cent. in
which no evidence of any value as to the cause of death existed.
After what had already been done in the matter, all that appeared
to be necessary at present seemed to him to be that they should
forward a memorial to the Home Secretary, with a request that he
would consider the important work which had been already done
by the Select Committee, and, if he saw fit, take steps to embody
their recommendations in an Act of Parliament, for the purpose of
giving the country a greatly improved procedure in exchange for
that at present employed. Dr. Isambard Owen, in the absence of
Dr. Farquharson, M.P., seconded the resolution, and asserted that
the State now winked at an exceedingly loose system of death-certification,
since under the present procedure it was possible for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
a medical man to give a death-certificate on a patient whom he
might not have seen for an interval of several weeks, and perhaps
months. The resolution was supported by Dr. Nelson Hardy,
Dr. Alderson, Dr. Hugh Woods, Dr. Sykes, and others, and was
unanimously adopted.</p></div>

<p class="p1">A well-known physician in large practice, writing to
the author from a Midland town, October 10, 1895,
says:&mdash;“Medical men, attending patients seriously ill,
accept the statement of the friends that the patient died
in the night, and give a certificate at once, without any
inspection of the body. This is the regular practice.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">INTERMENTS WITHOUT CERTIFICATES.</div>

<p>In Ireland matters are no better, and clergymen and
others, with whom the author has been in correspondence,
say they are much worse, and the danger of
premature burial is, if possible, greater than it is in
England. The Rev. W. Walters, writing from Ventry
Parsonage, Dingle, Ireland, September 16, 1895, says:&mdash;“In
Ireland interment usually takes place the day after
decease, and no certificate as to the cause of death is
ever required. There is no safeguard whatever, and
amongst the ignorant poor I fear premature burial is
terribly frequent.”</p>

<p>A prominent medical officer of health, having charge
of a populous metropolitan parish, wrote to the author,
October 8, 1895, in reply to inquiries:&mdash;“When a doctor
attends a patient in an illness, and the patient dies, he
usually accepts the word of the friends as to the facts of
death, and if they are poor, or in moderate circumstances,
he grants the certificate in the ordinary way.
If he is satisfied as to the cause of death he dare not
refuse the certificate. You will see by the form I send
you that <i>he need not actually satisfy himself that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
patient is dead</i>; if he is not satisfied he writes, ‘As I am
informed,’ in the space left for the words.... On
one occasion I was directed by a lady to drive a very
long hat-pin through her heart after death, to ensure
that she should not be buried alive. I have given so
little attention to the matter that I cannot say if the
Continental practice in this respect is better than ours.
<i>Signs of decomposition are, I believe, the only ones of any
real value.</i> The form of certificate of death referred to
is marked, ‘Printed by authority of the Registrar-General,’
and a request marked ‘N.B.’ is to read the
suggestions on page ii. In this other form, which is
entitled ‘Suggestions to medical practitioners respecting
certificates of the cause of death,’ elaborate instructions
are set forth under ten separate clauses, with examples
showing in what way the death-certificates are to be
filled up, but not one word of instruction or caution as
to the fact of death&mdash;whether it be real or apparent&mdash;the
absolute signs of death, or the steps to be taken in
doubtful cases, or in the various forms of suspended
animation, such as coma, trance, catalepsy, etc.”</p>

<p>The <i>Times</i>, January 19, 1878, p. 9, foot of column 6,
reports a singular case in point:&mdash;</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Premature.</span>&mdash;A poor woman lay very ill in her
scantily-furnished home in Sheffield. The doctor was
sent for, and came. He at once saw that hers was a
very grave case, and that she had, as he thought, little
chance of recovery, even if she could get the nourishment
her illness required. As he was about to leave, the
question was put, ‘When should we send for you again,
doctor?’ ‘Well,’ was the reply, as he looked at the
poor woman and then at her wretched surroundings, ‘I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
don’t think you need send for me again. She cannot
possibly get better; and to save you further trouble I’ll
just write you out a certificate for her burial.’ And he
did. After the doctor departed the woman&mdash;women
always were wilful&mdash;got better rapidly. She has now
completely recovered, and goes about carrying her burial
certificate with her.&mdash;<i>Sheffield Telegraph.</i>”</p>

<div class="sidenote">WORTHLESS DEATH-CERTIFICATES.</div>

<p>Dr. Charles Cameron, M.P., in moving the introduction
of the Disposal of the Dead (Regulation) Bill, in
the House of Commons, on April 30, 1884, said:&mdash;“A
very large number of our population die without any
medical attendance at all, or at least without having
ever received sufficient medical attention to enable a
certificate of the cause of death to be given worth the
paper on which it is written. In many of these cases
some sort of worthless certificate is procured and presented
to the registrar, but many thousands of persons
are each year buried in the United Kingdom without
even this formality.”</p>

<p>The contrast between the laxity at home and the
regulations laid down by authority in Würtemburg,
Bavaria, and other Continental States, is remarkable,
and should receive the attention of the Registrar-General
without delay.</p>

<p class="p1">From the <i>Lancet</i>, 1890, vol. i., p. 1440:&mdash;</p>


<p class="pc1">“UNCERTIFIED CAUSES OF DEATH IN ENGLAND.</p>

<p>“Considering the general progress that has been made
in public health during the last twenty years, it is seriously
to be regretted that this matter of unknown and uncertified
causes of death has been practically left untouched,
and its settlement is, therefore more urgently needed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
now than when so often pressed upon the public notice
by the late Dr. William Farr during his connection with
the Registrar-General’s department.”</p>

<p>The Parliamentary Committee above referred to
omitted an unexampled opportunity of inquiring into
the facts of premature burial. They could have summoned
pathologists, who had made trance and catalepsy
a subject of close and searching investigation, as well as
physicians, who, in their practice, have been called in to
decide upon cases of apparent death, and of witnesses
up and down the country who know of such cases, and
others who have met with narrow escapes from these
horrible mishaps. Instead of taking this reasonable
course of procedure, the Committee contented themselves
by examining two or three medical men, who had
been summoned to give evidence upon the irregularities
of death-certification only, and whose negative and
apathetic replies showed either that the subject had
never engaged their attention, or that they were unwilling
to charge any member of the profession with a
fault so ruinous to his professional reputation as to be
unable to discriminate between the living and the dead.
No questions were submitted to the witnesses as to the
signs of death, the characteristics of catalepsy, trance,
asphyxia, syncope, etc., or how to distinguish these from
death, or as to the submission of tests in doubtful cases
in order to ascertain the fact of death. Indeed, it may
be observed that the investigation regarding a most
vital point connected with death-certification appears to
have entirely escaped the notice of this tribunal. As a
specimen of the proceedings under this head are the
following (“Report,” p. 116)&mdash;Mr. John Tatham, M.A.,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>

<p>“Sir,&mdash;The newspapers continue to give us fresh accounts of
premature burials. Seeing how frequently cases are heard of (in
spite of the exhumations being not one-thousandth per cent. of the
interments), the occurrence is probably far more common than is
generally supposed. It is, therefore, surprising that medical men
have not discovered an infallible evidence of death&mdash;whatever the
cause of death may be; or a simple means of proving, beyond the
possibility of doubt, that life is extinct. Further, the application
of such a test should, by law, be made to form part of the certificate

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p class="psh">VERIFICATION OF DEATHS.</p>

<p>“In Paris and the large French towns medical inspectors,
called <i>médecins verificateurs</i>, are appointed,
whose business it is to visit each house where a death
occurs, and ascertain that the person is really dead, and
that there are no suspicious circumstances connected
with his or her decease. More than eighty qualified
medical men are employed for this purpose in Paris.</p>

<p>“In the rural districts of France this system is not in
force; two witnesses making a declaration to a civil
officer that a death has taken place, is considered
sufficient. The burial is not allowed to take place until
at least twenty-four hours after the declaration.”&mdash;<i>Blyth:
Dictionary of Hygiene and Public Health.</i></p>

<p>Dr. Léonce Lénormand, in his admirable work “Des
Inhumations Précipitées,” p. 140, accuses the <i>médecins
des morts</i> in France with culpable carelessness in the
exercise of their function, which consists in verifying
the reality of the death. Instead of making a minute
examination of the body to ascertain the fact of death,
this writer says they are content (except in cases of
death from violence) to merely glance at the body, and
immediately to hand the family the necessary authorisation
for interment.<span class="sidenote">VERIFICATIONS ILLUSORY.</span> The inspector knows that if he
examined every part of the body, as in duty bound,
he would be accused of barbarism and profanation.
Those, therefore, who think that premature burial could
be prevented in England by means only of a more
stringent law of compulsory death-certification, would,
if it were carried, find themselves in hardly any better
position than at present, where the fact of death is left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
to a great extent to the judgment of friends, if the
deceased has any, or to the perfunctory inspection of
the undertaker. It is in France where probably, in
spite of <i>médecins verificateurs</i>, more premature burials
occur than in any country in Europe except Turkey,
immediate burial after real or apparent death being
the inexorable rule. Dr. Lénormand attributes the frequency
of premature burials in France, first of all, to the
negligence and prejudices of the families of the deceased;
then to the carelessness of the doctors charged by the
State with the inspection of the dead; and lastly, to the
imperfection of the police regulations.</p>

<p>From the <i>British Medical Journal</i>, January 28, 1893,
p. 204. (Special Correspondence, Paris.)</p>

<p class="psh">“PREMATURE BURIAL.</p>

<p>“The question whether premature burial occurs, and
how to prevent it, is, notwithstanding the all-absorbing
interest of the Panama question, attracting some attention
here. The ‘Union Medicale’ devotes one of its
feuilletons to it, in which two or three <i>nouvelles à sensation</i>
are reproduced, and easily proved to be untrue.
Premature burial cannot occur, the writer says, when
a death is duly verified. The 77th Article of the Code
obliges the <i>officier de l’état civil</i> to visit the death-bed
and verify every death; but this Article is a dead letter.
The officer in question has neither time nor knowledge
sufficient to put it in practice. In small country places,
rarely any precautions are taken to prevent premature
burials. In more important villages and towns, the
mayors delegate the doctors of the locality to verify
deaths before burial. Throughout the whole of France,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
it appears that there are not fifty towns where the death-verifying
service is well organised; and, on an average,
there are from twenty thousand to thirty thousand
burials without previous verification of death. The
declaration of two witnesses is sufficient, who obtain
their information from those around the deceased. In
Paris, the two mortuaries already in existence&mdash;one at
the Montmartre Cemetery, the other at Père La Chaise&mdash;are
rarely used. The bodies of those who die in the
streets, from accident or sudden death, are taken there
when there is no domicile; also, those of foreigners
who die in lodging-houses. In the course of eighteen
months the mortuary of Montmartre received five dead
bodies, and Père La Chaise one. In Germany the mortuaries
are much used, and every arrangement made is
in order that any who come back to life may be able
to easily summon help. At Munich, a ring in connection
with a bell-cord is put on one of the fingers
of the hands of the dead. At Frankfort, similar precautions
are taken.”</p>

<p class="psh">EXAMINATION AND CERTIFICATION OF THE DEAD
IN WÜRTEMBURG.</p>

<p>A Royal Decree, entitled “Dienst-Vorschriften für
Leichenhaüser,” for the inspection and burial of the
dead, promulgated by the King of Würtemburg,
January 24, 1884, provides for the appointment of
medical inspectors of the highest integrity and qualifications
in every commune, the position being justly
regarded as one of great responsibility.</p>

<p>Immediately after a death, the body must under no
circumstances be interfered with, and must not be
removed from the death-bed until after the authorised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
inspection. <i>Post-mortems</i> can be made only if the fact
of death has been previously clearly established. Precise
instructions are laid down, so that the inspector, who
is to examine the entire body, may see that the various
forms of suspended animation are not certified as actual
death. Amongst these are the following:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“Section ii.&mdash;To see that sensibility, pulsation of the heart, neck,
temples, and forearm, and the breath, have ceased. That the
muscles of the body have lost their elasticity; therefore the limbs
are limp, the face sunken, the nose pinched, the eyes sunken, and,
when the eyelids are forcibly opened, they remain so, the lower
jaw drops more or less, and drops again when pressed upwards.</p>

<p>“In actual death the body gradually gets colder, beginning with
the exposed limbs, and in from ten to sixteen hours the body will
be quite cold. The colour of the face becomes ashy pale, and the
lips discoloured. The eye loses its brilliancy, and is usually dulled
by a covering of dried mucus.</p>

<p>“If all the foregoing symptoms are exhibited, and particularly
if the deceased was of an advanced age, or if the death was caused
by severe or long illness, which led to the expectation of a fatal
result, the fact of death may be safely assumed.</p>

<p>“But, on the other hand, if part of these symptoms are missing,
or in cases of pregnancy, or exhaustion in consequence of flooding
after confinement, or if death occurs under fits, or in violent outbursts
of passion, the possibility of counterfeit-death is to be taken
for granted.</p>

<p>“Notwithstanding the existence of all the symptoms (signs of
death) before mentioned, the possibility of <i>apparent</i> death is not
excluded in cases where the death has occurred after syncope,
tetanus, suffocation, or in cases of drowning, stroke of lightning,
or from a severe fall, or from frost, or in still-born children.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">After detailing instructions as to a variety of experiments
to ascertain whether the death is actual or
apparent, this Royal Decree proceeds:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Section viii.&mdash;These experiments may, however, not give
absolute certainty as to the complete extinction of all life. If,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
therefore, the slightest doubt remains as to the reality of death,
the inspector is to take the necessary precautions for the protection
of the deceased, by frequent inspections, and the most careful
examinations, and to obtain the assistance of the nearest physician
or surgeon, who is to co-operate with him to promote resuscitation.
If these attempts prove abortive, he must see that nothing is
done which would be detrimental to reanimation, or resumption
of life.”</p>

<p class="p1">Then follow minute instructions how to proceed
under the varied circumstances which may have produced
the symptoms known as apparent death. <i>In no
case must the burial certificate be handed over by the
inspector until he has thoroughly satisfied himself of the
presence of unmistakable signs of actual death.</i></p>

<p>One cannot help contrasting these carefully considered
rules with the lax and haphazard methods of
dealing with the dead and apparent dead both in
England and in the United States. As a consequence,
cases of premature burial in Würtemburg are of very
rare occurrence, and sensible people in that country,
knowing that the danger of premature burial has been
reduced to a minimum, are not consumed by an ever-abiding
anxiety as with us, nor is it the custom for
testators in Würtemburg to give instructions to their
executors for piercing the heart or severing the jugular
vein, or some other form of mutilation, as in France,
Spain, and other countries, where the risks are so
terribly great.</p>

<p>The only case of the danger of premature burial that
has come to the author’s notice in Würtemburg is related
by Bouchut, in his “Signes de la Mort,” p. 48:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<div class="sidenote1">IN WÜRTEMBURG.</div>

<p class="p1">“In the village of Achen, in Würtemburg, Mrs. Eva Meyers,
twenty-three years of age, was taken ill during an epidemic. Her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
condition became rapidly worse, and she apparently died. They
put her into a coffin, and carried her from the warm into a cold
room, there to await burial, which was to take place at two p.m.
on the following day. Shortly after noon on that day, and before
the carriers arrived, she awoke and made an effort to rise. Her
aunt, who was present, and who believed that a ghost had taken
possession of her, took a stick and would have killed her, if she
had not been prevented by another woman. Nevertheless, she
succeeded in pushing the body back violently into the coffin, after
which she indignantly went to her room. The patient remained
helplessly in that condition, and would have been buried if the
usual hour for the burial had not for some reason been changed.
Thus she remained for another twelve hours, when she was able
to gather sufficient strength to arise. She still lives, and has paid
the charges for her funeral, which were claimed by the clergy, the
bell-ringer, and the undertaker.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">In the United States the subject of Death-Verification
has only recently begun to engage public attention.
The following appears to be the only instance in which
reasonable, although not altogether adequate, precautions
are adopted.</p>

<p class="p1">“The giving of certificates of death, and the registration of

to Medical Men concerning the granting of Certificates of
Death.</i></p></div>

<p class="psh">A DOCTOR FOR THE DEAD.</p>

<p>Dr. J. Brindley James, in a communication to the
<i>Medical Times</i>, May 23, 1896, pp. 355-356, calls attention
to the insufficient safeguards against premature burial
under the present system of death-certification, and
observes&mdash;“The dread possibility of premature interment
ever hangs like a gloomy sword of Damocles over
all our heads, and fearful indeed is the authentic record
of persons buried alive, who have recovered consciousness;
too late, alas! to be rescued from their frightful
dungeon. How often does our overworked&mdash;we do not
say careless&mdash;practitioner sign the death-certificate of a
patient whose death-bed he did not attend&mdash;whose
corpse he has not visited? And even assuming him to
have done so, and conscientiously too, in how many of
the fearful cases above alluded to have not these formalities
proved insufficient, clearly suggesting the
advisability of a specialist, experienced in <i>post-mortem</i>
inspection, solely sanctioning interment in all cases.”
And Dr. Frederick Graves, writing in the same journal
of July 18, 1896, says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“I have recently heard of a case which illustrates the utility of
a medical examination before burial. A soldier in the German
army, during the forced march on Paris, became unconscious, with
five others, from sunstroke, and the six were put aside for burial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
by their comrades, when the timely examination of the army
surgeon prevented premature burial of the person referred to, who
is alive and well at the present time.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">The <i>Daily Chronicle</i>, London, September 16, 1895, in
a leading article on the danger of premature burial,
says:&mdash;“The truth is, the whole system of certifying for
burial needs to be reconsidered and reformed, and that
for other reasons than the danger of entombment before
life is extinct. We do not want a coroner’s inquest, with
its jury, for every death; but the doctors should be compelled,
under severe penalties, to discover the certain sign
of death before they authorise the burial, and to know
the cause of death in every case.<span class="sidenote">STRINGENT LEGISLATION SUGGESTED.</span> We trust now too
much to individuals in a generally trustworthy profession,
who may not reach the high general standard of
their class, or may grow listless through the indifference
wrought by use and wont, or who think they can detect
the <i>rigor mortis</i> at a glance, never having seen the
severest form of catalepsy. There would be no difficulty
in getting Parliament to pass a more stringent regulation
for death-certificates without much discussion, and
there is no reason why Sir Matthew White Ridley
should not turn his attention to the matter, and, with
such medical advice as the Health Department of the
Local Government Board will be pleased to lend him,
propose a necessary little bill to the House of Commons
next February.”</p>

<p>The following letter by a German resident in England
appeared in the <i>Times</i> of September 20, 1895:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="pc1">“BURIED ALIVE.</p>

<p>“Sir,&mdash;As this important subject appears to be arresting the
attention of the public in England, may I venture to state the law<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
as to the examination of corpses in my own country? In a copy
of the official regulations in Würtemburg for the inspection of
dead bodies (‘Dienst-Vorschriften für Leichenhaüser in Würtemburg,
1882.’ Stuttgart, W. Kohlhammer), I find the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>“‘No corpse must be interfered with before the arrival of the
inspector, who is expected to pay several visits before granting
the death-certificate, which he alone is authorised to do. In cases
of death from infectious disease the body must be removed to a
mortuary, where it is carefully watched.’</p>

<p>“These inspectors are highly qualified, State-appointed
physicians, but, as if to show the uncertainty of all this care and
experience, as we see by the researches of Dormodoff, Hufeland,
Hartmann, and others, as well as by the reports of startling cases
in the press, those medically and officially declared to be dead do
occasionally come to life before burial. This is a state of things
unworthy of the civilisation and humanity of which we are proud.</p>

<p>“Medical examination, not being infallible when carried out
at its best, must be very unreliable when performed in a careless
manner.</p>

<p>“A safer plan would be to send every supposed corpse to a
mortuary, there to remain until decomposition manifests itself.
As a German I should be afraid to die in England (excuse the
paradox) for fear of being buried alive.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER XIX.</h2>

<p class="pch">SUGGESTIONS FOR PREVENTION.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> learned Dr. Vigné, of Rouen, who won the respect
of his fellow-citizens during a long and honourable
career, was for many years engaged in the study of this
question, and published the result of his researches
shortly before his death. Convinced that the resources
of science were insufficient to distinguish real from
apparent death, he left testamentary instructions to
provide against his own premature burial. (“Des Inhumations
Précipitées, p. 83,” by Lénormand.)</p>

<p>Dr. Winslow, a French physician, who had on two
different occasions very nearly fallen a victim to premature
burial, having been laid out for dead, chose for
the subject of his thesis before the Paris Faculty of
Medicine, “Les moyens les plus propres à reconnaître
la réalité de la mort.” Dr. Winslow may be said to
have been the pioneer of a movement in France for
exposing the danger of, and educating the public into the
necessity of reforms in, the mode of treating the apparent
dead; and, although his efforts and warnings were as
of one crying in the wilderness or amongst an apathetic
people, with a legislature apparently uninfluenced either
by facts or by reason, they were never relaxed. Numerous
writers have since confirmed the truth of Dr. Winslow’s
contention by facts within their own experience, and it
is believed that legislation in France cannot be much
longer delayed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>

<p>That the risk of premature burial is not an imaginary
one, as recently declared by a leading London medical
journal, has been shown by the citation in this volume
of cases of death-like trance which have baffled the
ablest of medical experts; also the instances of numerous
narrow escapes from this terrible occurrence, and of
others where the victims were suffocated before timely
aid could be obtained, most of which are drawn from
medical sources, and some from the columns of the said
sceptical journal. The painful reality is also shown by
the multitude of preventive measures suggested by
medical authorities, and by the ingenious contrivances
of those who have made this distressing subject one of
patient and laborious research. Several of the remedies
suggested for adoption in cataleptic cases are really
homicidal, or seriously mutilative; many of them are
impracticable, and have been shown by Hufeland,
Lénormand, Richardson, Hartmann, Bouchut, Fletcher,
and Gannal to be delusive. The merits and demerits
of some of these methods might be inquired into by the
appointment of a Parliamentary Committee, or a Royal
Commission, as a supplement to that appointed in 1893,
by Mr. Asquith, on Death-Certification.</p>

<p class="psh">CUTANEOUS EXCITATION.</p>

<p>Dr. James Curry, F.R.S., in his “Observations on
Apparent Death,” pp. 56, 57, says, concerning the
application of stimulants to the skin:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“To assist in rousing the activity of the vital principle, it has
been customary to apply various stimulating matters to different
parts of the body. But, as some of these applications are in
themselves positively hurtful, and the others serviceable only
according to the time and manner of their employment, it will be
proper to consider them particularly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>

<p>“The application of all such matters in cases of apparent death
is founded upon the supposition that the skin still retains sensibility
enough to be affected by them. It is well known, however,
that even during life the skin loses sensibility in proportion as it
is deprived of heat, and does not recover it again until the natural
degree of warmth be restored. Previous to the restoration of
heat, therefore, to a drowned body, all stimulating applications
are useless, and, so far as they interfere with the other measures,
are also prejudicial.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">Several writers, besides Dr. Winslow, whose views on
premature burial are cited in this volume, have themselves
been the victims of hasty and erroneous medical
diagnosis; and, having had narrow escapes of premature
burial, their experience has prompted them to take a
deep interest in the subject, with the determination to
do what they could to enlighten and safeguard the
public from so terrible a danger. In other cases,
members of their families have been the unhappy victims
of mistaken certificates. Mr. George T. Angell, the
editor of “<i>Dumb Animals</i>,” Boston, U.S., whose father
was pronounced by his physician dead, and returned to
consciousness after preparations for the funeral had been
made, has repeatedly alluded to the subject in his paper,
and published preventive suggestions at various times,
including the following from a physician:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“When I arrived, the man had been dead twenty-four hours. I
empanelled a jury; the family of the deceased testified to the
extent of their knowledge; but I was unable to find he had any
disease sufficient to kill him. I looked at the body and examined
it carefully. Then I lighted a match, and applied it to the end of
one of the fingers of the corpse. Immediately a blister formed.
I had the man put back into his bed, applied various restoratives,
and to-day he is alive and well.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>“That is the test. Do you see the philosophy of it? If you are
alive, you cannot burn your hand without raising a blister. Nature,
in the effort to protect the inner tissues, throws a covering of
water, a non-conductor of heat, between the fire and the flesh. If
you were dead, and flames should come in contact with any part
of your body, no blister would appear, and the flesh would be
burned.</p>

<p>“All you have to do is to apply a match to any part of the
supposed corpse. If life remains, however little, a blister will at
once form.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">The test, like the following one, is deceptive, because
life may be so torpid and inactive as to be unable to
respond to the irritation of heat, or even to the application
of red hot irons.</p>

<p class="psh">THE BLISTER TEST.</p>

<p>The <i>British Medical Journal</i>, January 18, 1896, p.
180, under the head of “Living or Dead?” prints the
following communication concerning this test:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p>“Sir,&mdash;Burial alive, though of exceedingly rare occurrence,
sometimes does happen, and calls for increased
attention to the means of detecting with certainty the
presence of vitality, however feeble. The ordinary
means of deciding the vital question are known to all
persons. Auscultation may detect the enfeebled heart-beat,
while the electric battery can elicit any existing
muscular contractility. Conditions of trance are occasionally
almost mystical in their profundity (Brahmin
trance), and a simple and ready-to-hand test to decide
whether death has occurred is of prime importance.
We can ascertain whether or not life still lingers in
uncertain cases by <span class="sidenote1">THE BLISTER TEST.</span> applying (say) to the back of the
forearm a small stream of boiling water directly from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
the kettle. If life is present, the boiling water will soon
and unfailingly raise a blister where applied, and the
blister will contain fluid, the serum of the blood. The
production of the serum blister being essentially a vital
process, its production or non-production becomes an
infallible test, and determines the question. This test,
not generally known, should be widely proclaimed.</p>

<p class="pr2">“<span class="smcap">J. Milford Barnett</span>, M.D., Edin.</p>

<p>“Belfast, January 11, 1896.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">This test has frequently failed, and should not be
relied upon.</p>

<p class="psh">AUSCULTATION.</p>

<p>The stethoscope, which is regarded by many medical
practitioners as an infallible means of preventing premature
burial, has proved a broken reed in hundreds of
cases, and can be of use only when applied with other
tests. Dr. Roger S. Chew, of Calcutta, writes to me,
February, 1896:&mdash;</p>

<p>“The <i>British Medical Journal</i> (September 28, 1895)
tells us that the careful use of the stethoscope will enable
a medical man to distinguish a living from a dead body.
<span class="sidenote">AUSCULTATION.</span>Auscultation may give startling results, and the body
yet be absolutely dead. I recollect an instance of death
from cobra-bite, when, though decomposition had set in,
the relatives refused to believe she was dead, because
one of them declared that, though he did not see her
chest rise and fall, he had distinctly heard her sigh. A
medical man was called in, applied the stethoscope over
her thorax, and declared he could hear sounds from her
lungs, and a peculiar ‘<i>sough</i>,’ ‘<i>sough</i>’ towards the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
apex of the heart. So far he was right, but, as the girl
had already been dead some fourteen hours, and the
weather was warm, the sounds he heard were those of
the escape of the putrefactive gases bubbling upward
and unable to find exit, as her mouth was closed with
a chin-bandage, and her nostrils plugged with mucus.
To convince the parents that the girl was really
dead, I offered to perform artificial respiration, to
which end I untied the bandage, prized open her jaws,
and pressed <i>heavily</i> on her thorax, when some of the
imprisoned gases escaped, emitting an abominable odour
that brought conviction of the girl being beyond all
hope.</p>

<p>“In another case, that of my son, aged two years, after
a series of brain symptoms and severe clonic convulsions
preceding an outbreak of confluent small-pox, the stethoscope
told me and a medical friend who was present
that my little boy had ceased to exist; but a liberal
application of ice to his head and cardiac region, together
with violent friction and artificial respiration vigorously
employed for <i>forty</i> minutes, restored the child to me,
and I thanked God that I had refused to accept the
evidence of the stethoscope as final.”</p>

<p class="psh">ELECTRICITY.</p>

<p>The application of the electric current is a powerful
restorative agent in cases of suspended animation, if
judiciously applied. Struve in his essay, “Suspended
Animation,” p. 151, under the head of “Apparent
death from a fall,” says:&mdash;“A girl, three years of
age, fell from a window two stories high upon
the pavement. Though she was considered as lifeless,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
Mr. Squires, a natural philosopher, applied electricity.
Almost twenty minutes elapsed before the shocks produced
any effect. At last when some of the electric
force pervaded the breast he observed a slight motion
of the heart. The child soon after began to breathe
and groan with great difficulty, and after some minutes
a vomiting ensued. For a few days the patient remained
in a state of stupefaction, but in the course of a week
she was perfectly restored to health.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE ELECTRICAL TEST.</div>

<p>Referring to the subject of premature burial, Dr. W.
S. Hedley, writing to the <i>Lancet</i>, October 5, 1895,
says:&mdash;“Forty years ago the subject was investigated
by Crimotel, twenty years later by Rosenthal, and more
recently by Onimus. It seems safe to say that in no
disease, certainly in none of those conditions usually
enumerated as likely to be mistaken for death, is
galvanic and faradaic excitability abolished in every
muscle of the body. On the other hand, electro-muscular
contractility disappears in all the muscles
within a few hours after death (generally ninety minutes
to three hours, according to Rosenthal), its persistence
varying to some extent with the particular muscle
examined (1), and with the mode of death (2). Therefore,
if electro-muscular contractility be present in any
muscle, it means life or death only a few hours before.
It is clear that no interment or <i>post-mortem</i> examination
ought to take place so long as there is any flicker of
electric excitability. To me it seems almost equally
obvious that in all doubtful cases, sometimes in sudden
death, and often to allay the anxiety of friends, this test
ought to be applied, and applied by one who is accustomed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
to handle electric currents for purposes of
diagnosis.”</p>

<p>The <i>Medical Record</i>, New York, March 30, 1895,
contains the following:&mdash;“In a case reported by M.
D’Arsonval, a man was struck with a current of four
thousand five hundred volts. The current entered at
his hand and issued at his back. Half an hour or more
elapsed before any attempts at resuscitation were made,
but, on artificial respiration being practised on Silvester’s
method, recovery took place. Dr. Donnellan reports a
case of the passage of a current of one thousand volts
through a man, which instantly caused coma, dilated
pupils, pallor of the face, and sweating; delirium and
tonic, alternating with clonic, spasms followed. The pulse
was eighty. The respiration, at first stertorous, passed
into the Cheyne-Stokes type. After the injection, first
of morphia, and then of strychnia, the patient fell into a
deep sleep, from which he awoke convalescent.&mdash;<i>Centralblatt
für die medicinischen Wissenschaften.</i>”</p>

<p>The apparatus for applying electrical currents, long
used by the Humane Society for restoration of the
drowned, might with advantage be kept at public
mortuaries, for use in cases of apparent death due to
other causes, where decomposition has not manifested
itself. The Weather Bureau at Washington advises
those who are in the neighbourhood of persons struck
by lightning to make immediate efforts to restore consciousness,
because the effect of lightning is to suspend
animation rather than to produce death. Respiration
and circulation should be stimulated, and the usual
remedies for relief in such cases should be administered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
for at least an hour before giving up the victim as
dead.</p>

<p>Dr. Moore Russell Fletcher says:&mdash;“When persons
without pulse or breathing are found in bed, in the field,
or elsewhere, treat them in such manner as will restore
from stroke of lightning, paralysis, or suspended animation
from catalepsy, trance, or somnambulism, and
continue the treatment until resuscitation rewards the
exertions, or decomposition is evident.”&mdash;<i>Suspended
Animation, pp. 7, 8.</i></p>

<p class="psh">HYPODERMIC INJECTIONS.</p>

<p>Mr. E. E. Carpmael, of the Medical Department,
Berkeley University, U.S.A., recommends, in the <i>Morning
Post</i>, London, September 19, 1895, the injection of
strychnine in “a supposed corpse;” while “Medicus,”
in the <i>Daily Chronicle</i>, September 17, 1895, considers
that <i>post-mortems</i> “would be to the advantage of the
patient, to his relations, to science, and the community
at large.” No doubt either of these plans would prevent
live sepulture, by killing the cataleptic subject; while
“M.R.C.S.,” in <i>Morning Post</i>, September 20, says:&mdash;“Obviously
the simplest and best proof of death is
putrefaction&mdash;shown chiefly by the discolouration of
the abdomen.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">HYPODERMIC INJECTIONS.</div>

<p>A correspondent in the <i>English Mechanic</i>, October
25, 1895, says:&mdash;“I have long advised hypodermic
injection of morphia before placing in coffin for
burial. <i>Ex hypothesi</i>, the vital spark is not supposed
to have expired, and the circulatory system not finally
stopped. Hence the hypodermic injection cannot
be futile.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>

<p>A medical correspondent writing from Dresden,
August 18, 1895, sends me the following as showing
the value of</p>

<p class="psh">ARTIFICIAL RESPIRATION.</p>

<p>“Major J. H. Patzki, Surgeon, U.S. Army, reports that
in 1882, at St. Augustine, Florida, a lady patient of his
had an attack of tetanus, caused by a scratch upon her
foot by a nail while bathing. The convulsive symptoms
commenced in the muscles of the face, and increased in
violence in spite of energetic treatment, until the fifth
day, when the respiratory muscles became involved.
The breathing was completely suspended by the spasmodic
action, and the radial and carotid pulse ceased.
The cardiac sounds became utterly inaudible to careful
stethoscopic examination repeatedly employed. The
lady assumed all the appearances of death, and there
was <i>rigor mortis</i>, the result of muscular spasm. Artificial
respiration was resorted to, but not until after the
expiration of eighteen minutes did the first faint efforts
of respiration, and a feeble action of the heart, become
perceptible. Artificial respiration was continued for an
hour afterwards, and the life of the patient was saved,
although the muscular spasms continued to some extent
for six days.</p>

<p>“This case is instructive in showing that tetanus, when
it involves the chest, may produce a state of apparent
death, by interfering with the respiratory and cardiac
functions; and that artificial respiration, if persistently
employed, may rescue patients so affected from the
perils of apparent death.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">DR. JOHN OSWALD’S OPINION.</div>

<p>Dr. John Oswald, in “Suspended Animal Life,”
Philadelphia, 1802, p. 65, says:&mdash;“The books of authors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
on this subject are replete with criteria to judge of the
existence or non-existence of the vital principle. It is
not necessary to take a separate view of the propriety
or impropriety of adopting any of these ambiguous
signs, when we have the accomplishment of so great an
end as that of restoring suspended life! Our exertions
should never be influenced by any of them, but continued
with ardour and unremitted attention for a
length of time. It would be more happy for our unfortunate
patients, and a source of greater satisfaction
to ourselves, were they expunged altogether. They
are all fallacious to a certain degree, and ought never
to have the smallest influence on the propriety or impropriety
of persevering in our attempts to revive the
latent spark; for it is an unfortunate fact, in consequence
of an ignorant confidence placed in them,
that persons who might have been restored to life, to
their friends, and to society have been consigned to the
grave.... This important subject has been anxiously
investigated by philosophers, to discover a just criterion
of judging with more certainty in these cases whether
life is extinct, and our patient a mass of dead matter,
or whether, by our perseverance, he may not be again
recovered. The most indubitable sign is allowed to be
putrefaction of the body, or disorganisation of the
fibre.”</p>

<p>The following extracts from an instructive but apparently
forgotten article in Dickens’ “All the Year
Round,” July, 1869 (<i>à propos</i> of a pamphlet, “Lettre
sur la Mort Apparente, les Conséquences Réelles des
Inhumations Précipitées, et le Temps pendant lequel
peut persister l’Aptitude à être rappellé à la Vie,” by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
the late regretted Dr. Charles Londe), afford valuable
suggestions:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“Suffocation by foul air and mephitical gas is not a rare form of
death in the United Kingdom. It is possible that suspended animation
may now and then have been mistaken for the absolute
extinction of life. Dr. Londe gives an instructive case to the
purpose. At the extremity of a large grocer’s shop, a close,
narrow corner, or rather hole, was the sleeping-place of the shopman
who managed the night sale till the shop was closed, and
who opened the shutters at four in the morning. On the 16th of
January, 1825, there were loud knocks at the grocer’s door. As
nobody stirred to open it, the grocer rose himself, grumbling at
the shopman’s laziness, and, proceeding to his sleeping-hole to
scold him, he found him motionless in bed, completely deprived
of consciousness. Terror-struck by the idea of sudden death, he
immediately sent in search of a doctor, who suspected a case of
asphyxia by mephitism. His suspicions were confirmed by the
sight of a night-lamp, which had gone out, although supplied with
oil and wick, and by a portable stove containing the remains of
charcoal partly reduced to ashes. In spite of a severe frost, he
immediately had the patient taken into the open air, and kept on
a chair in a position as nearly vertical as possible. The limbs of
the sufferer hung loose and drooping, the pupils were motionless,
with no trace either of breathing or pulsation of the heart or
arteries; in short, there were all the signs of death. The most
approved modes of restoring animation were persisted in for a
long while without success. At last, about three in the afternoon&mdash;that
is, after <i>eleven hours’</i> continued exertion&mdash;a slight movement
was heard in the region of the heart. A few hours afterwards
the patient opened his eyes, regained consciousness, and
was able to converse with the spectators attracted by his resurrection.
Dr. Londe draws the same conclusions as before&mdash;namely,
that persons suffocated by mephitism are not unfrequently buried
when they might be saved.”</p>

<div class="sidenote1">DANGER TO CHOLERA PATIENTS.</div>

<p>“We have had cholera in Great Britain, and we may have it
again. At such trying times, if ever, hurried interments are not
merely excusable, but almost unavoidable. Nevertheless, one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
the peculiarities of that fearful disease is to bring on some of the
symptoms of death&mdash;the prostration, the coldness, and the dull
livid hues&mdash;long before life has taken its departure. Now, Dr.
Londe states, as an acknowledged fact, that patients pronounced
dead of cholera have been repeatedly seen to move one or more
of their limbs after death. While M. Trachez (who had been sent
to Poland to study the cholera) was opening a subject in the
dead-house of the Bagatelle Hospital, in Warsaw, he saw another
body (that of a woman of fifty, who had died in two days, having
her eyes still bright, her joints supple, but the whole surface
extremely cold) which vividly moved its left foot ten or twelve
times in the course of an hour. Afterwards, the right foot participated
in the same movement, but very feebly. M. Trachez sent
for Mr. Searle, an English surgeon, to direct his attention to the
phenomenon. Mr. Searle <i>had often remarked it</i>. The woman,
nevertheless, was left in the dissecting-room, and thence taken to
the cemetery. Several other medical men stated that they had
made similar observations. From which M. Trachez draws the
inference: ‘It is allowable to think that many cholera patients
have been buried alive.’”</p>

<p>“Dr. Veyrat, attached to the Bath Establishment, Aix, Savoy,
was sent for to La Roche (Department of the Yonne), to visit a
cholera patient, Thérèse X., who had lost all the members of her
family by the same disease. He found her in a complete state of
asphyxia. He opened a vein; not a drop of blood flowed. He
applied leeches; they bit, and immediately loosed their hold. He
covered the body with stimulant applications, and went to take a
little rest, requesting to be called if the patient manifested any
signs of life. The night and next day passed without any change.
While making preparations for the burial, they noticed a little
blood oozing out of the leech-bites. Dr. Veyrat, informed of the
circumstance, entered the chamber just as the nurse was about to
wrap the corpse in its winding-sheet. Suddenly a rattling noise
issued from Thérèse’s chest. She opened her eyes, and in a
hollow voice said to the nurse: ‘What are you doing here? I
am not dead. Get away with you.’ She recovered, and felt no
other inconvenience than a deafness, which lasted about two
months.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span></p>

<p>“Exposure to cold may also induce a suspension of vitality
liable to be mistaken for actual death. This year the French
Senate has again received several petitions relative to premature
interments.... And, considering the length of time that
trances, catalepsies, lethargies, and cases of suspended animation
have been known occasionally to continue, it is scarcely, in
England, less interesting to us, though public feeling, which is
only an expression of natural affection, approves, and indeed
almost compels, a longer delay. The attention of the French
Government being once more directed to the subject, there is
little doubt that all reasonable grounds for fear will be removed.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>“The petitioners have requested, as a precaution, that all
burials for the future should, in the first instance, be only provisional.
Before filling a grave, a communication is to be made
between the coffin and the upper atmosphere by means of a
respiratory tube; and the grave is not to be finally closed until
all hope of life is abandoned. These precautions, it will be seen
at once, however good in theory, are scarcely practicable. Others
have demanded the general establishment of mortuary chambers,
or dead-houses, like those in Germany. And not only the petitioners,
but several senators, seem to consider that measure
the full solution of the problem. Article 77 of the Civil Code
prescribes a delay of twenty-four hours only, which appears to
them to be insufficient, since, they urge, it admits the certainty
that death has taken place only after putrefactive decomposition
has set in. Now, a much longer time than twenty-four hours may
elapse before that decomposition manifests itself. Deposit, therefore,
your dead in a mortuary chapel, until you are perfectly sure,
from the evidence of your senses, that life is utterly and hopelessly
extinct.</p>

<div class="sidenote1">DIFFICULTY OF DIAGNOSIS.</div>

<p>“When Article 77 of the Civil Code was under discussion
by the Council of State, Fourcroy added: ‘It shall be specified
that the civil officer be assisted by an officier de santé (a
medical man of inferior rank to a doctor of medicine); because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
there are cases in which it is difficult to make certain that death
has actually occurred, without a thorough knowledge of its
symptoms, and because there are tolerably numerous examples
to prove that people <i>have</i> been buried alive.’</p>

<p>“In Paris, especially since Baron Hausmann’s administration,
Article 77 has been strictly fulfilled; but the same exactitude
cannot be expected in out-of-the-way nooks and corners of
the country, where a doctor cannot always be found at a
minute’s warning, to declare whether death be real or apparent
only. It is clear that the Legislature has hit upon the sole indisputable
practical solution; the difficulty lies in its rigorous and
efficient application.</p>

<p>“It has been judiciously remarked that it would be a good plan
to spread the knowledge of the sure and certain characteristics
which enable us to distinguish every form of lethargy from real
death. It cannot be denied that at the present epoch the utmost
pains are taken to popularise every kind of knowledge. Nevertheless,
it makes slow way through the jungles of prejudice and
vulgar error. Not long ago it was over and over again asserted that
an infallible mode of ascertaining whether a person was dead or
not was to inflict a burn on the sole of the foot. If a blister full of
water resulted, the individual was not dead; if the contrary happened,
there was no further hope. This error was unhesitatingly
accepted as an item of the popular creed.</p>

<p>“The Council of Hygiene, applied to by the Government, indicated
putrefaction and cadaverous rigidity as infallible signs of
actual death. In respect to the first&mdash;putrefaction&mdash;a professional
man is not likely to make a mistake; but nothing is more possible
than for non-professionals to confound hospital rottenness
(gangrene) with true <i>post-mortem</i> putrefaction. M. de Parville
declines to admit it as a test adapted for popular application.
Moreover, in winter, the time required for putrefaction to manifest
itself is extremely uncertain.</p>

<p>“The cadaverous rigidity&mdash;the stiffness of a corpse&mdash;offers an
excellent mode of verifying death; but its value and importance
are not yet appreciable by everybody, or by the first comer.
Cadaverous rigidity occurs a few hours after death; the limbs,
hitherto supple, stiffen; and it requires a certain effort to make
them bend. But when once the faculty of bending a joint is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
forcibly restored&mdash;to the arm, for instance&mdash;it will not stiffen
again, but will retain its suppleness. If the death be real, the
rigidity is overcome once for all. But if the death be only
apparent, the limbs quickly resume, with a sudden and jerking
movement, the contracted position which they previously occupied.
The stiffness begins at the top, the head and neck, and descends
gradually to the trunk.</p>

<p>“These characteristics are very clearly marked; but they must
be caught in the fact, and at the moment of their appearance,
because, after a time of variable duration, they disappear. The
contraction of the members no longer exists, and the suppleness
of the joints returns. Many other symptoms might be added to
the above; but they demand still greater clearness of perception,
more extended professional knowledge, and more practised habits
of observation.</p>

<p>“Although the French Government is anxious to enforce
throughout the whole empire the rules carried out in Paris, it is
to be feared that great difficulties lie in the way. The verification
of deaths on so enormous a scale, with strict minuteness, is almost
impracticable. But, even if it were not, many timid persons would
say: ‘Who is to assure us of the correctness of the doctor’s
observations? Unfortunately, too many terrible examples of their
fallibility are on record. The professional man is pressed for
time. He pays a passing visit; gives a hurried glance; and a
fatal mistake is so easily made!’ Public opinion will not be
reassured until you can show, every time a death occurs, an irrefutable
demonstration that life has departed.</p>

<p>“M. de Parville now announces the possibility of this great
desideratum. He professes to place in any one’s hands a self-acting
apparatus which would declare not only whether the death
be real, but <i>would leave in the hands of the experimenter a written
proof of the reality of the death</i>. The scheme is this: It is well
known that atropine&mdash;the active principle of <i>belladonna</i>&mdash;possesses
the property of considerably dilating the pupil of the
eye. Oculists constantly make use of it when they want to perform
an operation, or to examine the interior of the eye. Now, M.
le Docteur Bouchut has shown that atropine has no action on
the pupil when death is real. In a state of lethargy, the pupil,
under the influence of a few drops of atropine, dilates in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
course of a few minutes; the dilatation also takes place a few
instants after death; but it ceases absolutely in a quarter of an
hour, or half an hour at the very longest; consequently the
enlargement of the pupil is a certain sign that death is only
apparent.</p>

<div class="sidenote1">AN INGENIOUS CONTRIVANCE.</div>

<p>“This premised, imagine a little camera obscura, scarcely so big
as an opera-glass, containing a slip of photographic paper, which
is kept unrolling for five-and-twenty or thirty minutes by means of
clockwork. This apparatus, placed a short distance in front of
the dead person’s eye, will depict on the paper the pupil of the
eye, which will have been previously moistened with a few drops
of atropine. It is evident that, as the paper slides before the eye
of the corpse, if the pupil dilate, its photographic image will be
dilated; if, on the contrary, it remains unchanged, the image will
retain its original size. An inspection of the paper then enables
the experimenter to read upon it whether the death is real or
apparent only. This sort of declaration can be handed to the
civil officer, who will give a permit to bury in return.</p>

<p>“By this simple method a hasty or careless certificate of death
becomes impossible. The instrument applies the test, and counts
the minutes. The doctor and the civil officer are relieved from
further responsibility. The paper gives evidence that the verification
has actually and carefully been made; for suppose that half
an hour is required to produce a test that can be relied on, the
length of the strip of paper unrolled marks the time during which
the experiment has been continued. An apparatus of the kind
might be placed in the hands of the minister or one of the notables
of every parish. Such a system would silence the apprehensions
of the most timid; fears&mdash;natural enough&mdash;would disappear, and
the world would be shocked by no fresh cases of premature
burial.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">The authors have not heard whether this ingenious contrivance
had been put into practice, or with what result.</p>

<p>Various prizes have been offered, and awards made,
by scientific and medical societies, but, with one exception,
the so-called proofs of death for which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
awards have been given are deemed unsatisfactory.
The most notable of the prizes is that of the Marquis
d’Ourches, who by his will bequeathed the sum of twenty
thousand francs to be given to the author of the discovery
of a simple and common means of recognising beyond
doubt the absolute signs of death, by such a test as could
be adopted by poor villagers without technical instruction.
The Marquis d’Ourches left also a prize of five
thousand francs for a similar discovery, but requiring the
intervention of an expert. M. Pierre Manni, Professor at
the University of Rome, offered a prize, which was
awarded to Dr. E. Bouchut, in 1846. And M. Dusgate,
by will, dated January 11, 1872, bequeathed to the
French Academy of Sciences a sufficient sum in
French <i>Rentes</i>, to found a quinquennial prize of two
thousand five hundred francs to the author of the
best work on the diagnostic signs of death, and the
means of preventing premature interments. A decree
of November 27, 1874, authorised the Academy to
accept this legacy.</p>

<p>Dr. Gowers, on “Diseases of the Nervous System,”
vol. ii., p. 1037, says:&mdash;“In cases of ‘death-trance,’ in
which no sign of vitality can be recognised, the presence
of life may be ascertained (1) by the absence of any sign
of decomposition; (2) by the normal appearance of the
<i>fundus oculi</i> as seen with the ophthalmoscope; (3) by
the persistence of the excitability of the muscles to
electricity. This excitability disappears in three hours
after actual death. In a case observed by Rosenthal,
thirty hours after supposed death, the muscles were still
excitable, and the patient awoke.”</p>

<p>The <i>British Medical Journal</i>, January 21, 1893, p. 145,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
reports, through its Paris correspondent, the first award.
“The Académie des Sciences proposed as the subject for
the Dusgate Prize for 1890, ‘The Signs of Death, and the
Means of Preventing Premature Burial.’ The prize has
been awarded to Dr. Maze, who considers that putrefaction
is the only certain sign. He urges that the
deaths should be certified by medical men on oath;
also that in every cemetery there should be a mortuary
where dead bodies can be deposited, and that burial
should take place only when putrefactive changes set in.
Cremation should be adopted.”</p>

<p class="pch">CREMATION AS A PREVENTIVE OF PREMATURE BURIAL.</p>


<div class="sidenote">SUGGESTIONS FOR PREVENTION.</div>

<div class="sidenote">SIR HENRY THOMPSON’S OPINION.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Amongst</span> the numerous suggestions made by correspondents
in the press with a view of preventing live
sepulture, none has been more frequently put forward
than that of cremation. Sir Henry Thompson, the
president of the Cremation Society of England, in the
second edition of his admirable volume, “Modern Cremation:
Its History and Practice,” p. 41, observes:&mdash;“There
is a source of very painful dread&mdash;as I have
reason to know&mdash;little talked of, it is true, but keenly
felt by many persons at some time or another, the
horror of which to some is inexpressible. It is the
dread of a premature burial&mdash;the fear lest some deep
trance should be mistaken for death, and that the
awakening should take place too late. Happily such
occurrences must be exceedingly rare, especially in this
country, where the interval between death and burial is
considerable, and the fear is almost a groundless one.
Still, the conviction that such a fate is possible&mdash;which
cannot be altogether denied&mdash;will always be a source of
severe trial to some. With cremation no such catastrophe
could ever occur; and the completeness of a
properly-conducted process would render death instantaneous
and painless if by any unhappy chance an
individual so circumstanced were submitted to it. But
the guarantee against this danger would be doubled,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
since inspection of the entire body must of necessity
immediately precede the act of cremation, no such
inspection being possible under the present system.”
While agreeing with this distinguished authority as to
the advantages of cremation from the sanitary and
æsthetic point of view, which he dwells upon in the
treatise referred to, and admitting that a certain
amount of protection against live burial is obtainable
by means of the dual medical inspection, we cannot
agree that this protection is absolute. Cases of
trance are on record where some half a dozen doctors,
after careful examinations, have pronounced a cataleptic
patient to be dead, and the patient, in defiance of their
united opinion, has recovered consciousness, and been
restored to health.</p>

<p>Dr. Franz Hartmann, in his “Premature Burial,” quotes
the two following cases amongst many others:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“Madame de P&mdash;&mdash;, aged eighteen years, and subject to
hysteria, apparently died, and for forty hours she presented all
the signs of real death. All possible means of restoring her
to life were taken, but proved of no avail. <i>Five physicians of
Lyons were called in, and they finally agreed, positively, that the
lady was really dead.</i> The funeral preparations were made; but
owing to the supplications of a sister of the deceased the burial
was delayed, when after a while the patient recovered. She said
that she had been all the time aware of all that was going on,
without being able to give a sign, and without even being desirous
of attempting it.” (F. Kempner, p. 38.)</p>

<p>“In 1842 a remarkable affair occupied the attention of the
court at the city of Nantes. A man apparently died, and
<i>his death was certified to both by the attending physicians and the
medical inspector</i>; he was put into a coffin, and the religious ceremonies
were performed in good style. At the end of the funeral
service, and as he was about to be buried, he awoke from his
trance. The clergy and the undertakers sent in their accounts for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
the funeral expenses; but he refused to pay them, giving as his
reason that he had not ordered them; whereupon he was sued
for the money.” (F. Kempner, p. 39.)</p></div>

<p class="p1">Neither can we share the optimistic views of Sir
Henry Thompson as to the rarity of premature interment.
The results of searching and independent
inquiries and study in various countries by each of the
authors of this treatise all point the other way, and
the various authorities whose names and opinions are
cited elsewhere in this volume confess their astonishment
at the number of cases brought to light during their
investigations. The Rev. H. R. Haweis also, in his work
“Ashes to Ashes: A Cremation Prelude” (London, 1895,
now out of print), advocates cremation on the ground
of preventing living burial, and quotes several cases of
persons buried while in a state of trance. During a discussion
on the merits and demerits of cremation in the
<i>Birmingham Gazette</i>, September 17, 1895, Lieutenant-General
Phelps, an able and judicious observer,
advocated cremation for similar reasons, and said that
“the use of a crematorium would entirely prevent that
ghastly accident, the burial of the living. There is no
room to doubt that this frightful catastrophe is of
continual occurrence. The phenomena of trance are
little understood, and a certificate of death is held by
most of us to justify the burial of the ‘corpse,’ dead
or alive. Those of us who object to the risk of being
buried alive should do all in our power to promote the
success of this sanitary contrivance for disposing of
our dead.”</p>

<p class="pc1">“BURIAL DANGER AND ITS PREVENTION.</p>

<div class="sidenote1">COMMUNICATION TO THE “SUNDAY TIMES.”</div>

<p>“Madam,&mdash;When I was about five years old, my paternal
home was one day plunged into a state of great consternation,
through the sudden apparent death of my father, who had been
sitting up during a part of the previous night occupied with some
literary work, without a fire (it was in January), which brought on
a death-like numbness, in which he was found the next morning.
The family doctor, who was sent for at once, declared life to be
extinct, but said he could not tell the cause of death until after the
opening of the dead body. My mother, however, who did not see
any reason why a young man of thirty-six should have died without
any previous illness, caused the body of my father to be rubbed for
about two hours, which renewed its circulation and brought it to
life again. My father lived thirty-two years after that memorable
day. Without the prudence of my mother, he would either have
been dissected or buried alive. About twenty years after that
occurrence, I visited the cemetery of Père La Chaise (Paris),
accompanied by some friends. While inspecting the monuments
of some musical celebrities we heard a noise from another part of
the cemetery, whereto we proceeded without delay. When we
had arrived there we found a strong body of policemen surrounding
an open grave. But in answer to our inquiring ‘what had
happened,’ we were simply requested to leave the cemetery at
once, which, of course, we had to do. Neither the <i>portier</i> nor any
other person connected with the burial-ground would give any satisfactory
answer to our questions. We left puzzled. But a week
after, a young lady, who had been of our party the week before,
went again to the Père La Chaise, determined to penetrate the
mystery, in which endeavour she succeeded, partly through persuasion
and partly through the gift of a twenty-franc piece to a
grave-digger, who then told her the following story:&mdash;A poor
young man of twenty-one years had been buried on the day of
our visit. When the mourners had left the cemetery the grave-digger,
who was occupied in filling up the grave, heard some noise
coming from below. He hastened to the superintendent of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
cemetery, imploring him to have the coffin opened, which, however,
the superintendent could not do without the permission and
the presence of the Commissaire de Police of that district. When
the Commissaire appeared at last with his men, all was silent in
the grave. But he had the coffin opened, nevertheless, ‘to appease
the mind of that poor grave-digger,’ as he mockingly said. But
great was the horror of the Commissaire de Police and his followers
when the coffin was opened. The unfortunate young man
(who was now quite dead) had been buried alive, recovered consciousness
in his grave, scratched his face, bitten off the tips of his
fingers, and turned around in his coffin, until suffocation put an
end to his sufferings, which, if not long, must have been terrible.
The Parisian newspapers did not mention the case. They were
probably forbidden by the French Government to do so. But
would it not have been wiser to let the whole world know of it, and
thereby prevent repetitions of such dreadful occurrences? A
similar case of live sepulture occurred in a village near Wiesbaden
some thirty years ago, where a girl of sixteen was found with the
same signs of suffocation in her coffin as those of that unfortunate
young man in Paris. We are assured by a German authority that
thousands of people are buried alive every year. But why should
this be the case? If people must be buried before they begin to
show signs of putrefaction (which seems to be the only reliable
proof that life is really extinct), why not shorten their sufferings, in
case of resuscitation, by opening an artery before they are buried?
There is still much prejudice against the cremation of dead bodies,
although two great facts are decidedly in its favour&mdash;viz., the
impossibility of recovering consciousness when once inserted in
the crematory oven, and the prevention of the unhealthiness which
the slow process of putrefaction must entail.&mdash;Yours, etc.,</p>

<p class="p1">Professor Alexander Wilder, M.D., in his “Perils of
Premature Burial,” 1895, p. 16, says:&mdash;“I have often
wished that the old Oriental practice of cremation
was in fashion among us. There would then be at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
least the comfortable reflection of no liability to suffocation
in a coffin. The application of fire, however, will
generally rouse the cataleptic person to some manifestation
of life.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">CREMATION SOCIETY OF ENGLAND.</div>

<p>Having regard to the importance of the subject the
author wrote to the hon. secretary of the Cremation
Society of England, and received the following reply,
dated 8 New Cavendish Street, London, W.:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="p1">“With reference to your inquiry as to the steps adopted
to prevent a person in a trance being cremated, I may say
that this society has not made any special provision in
that respect. You will notice, however, that before a
cremation can be carried out, the cause of death must be
certified without the slightest shadow of doubt by two
duly qualified medical men. This being so, I think
there is less likelihood of a person who is simply in a
trance being cremated than buried, one doctor’s certificate
being sufficient in the latter case.</p>

<p class="pr2">“(Signed)<span class="vh">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</span><span class="smcap">T. C. Swinburne-Hanham</span>.”<br /></p></div>

<p class="p1">In the present state of medical knowledge on an
occult subject not usually taught in the medical schools,
and regarding phenomena as to which a large number of
medical men are sceptical, to say the least, we fail to see
how the fact of death, in the absence of putrefaction, can
be certified “beyond the slightest shadow of doubt.”
Many of the cases cited in this volume are those regarding
which the examining medical practitioners have been
most sure. The Rev. John Page Hopps, in <i>Light</i>, July 4,
1896, says:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“We are told that respect for the dead urges to burial as
against cremation, but many are now very keenly feeling the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
reverse of this. They can bring the mind to bear the liberation of
the body by one swift act of disintegration and purifying, but cannot
overcome the shrinking from subjecting it to the foul and
lingering processes of the grave&mdash;or, perchance, to the horror of
recovering consciousness in the grave.”</p>

<p class="p1">We take the occasion, however, to express on general
grounds our cordial adherence to the cremation movement.
Mr. Hopps further states one of the strongest
arguments thus:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Respect for the living, too, is an urgent motive. The highest
authorities tell us that the air we breathe and the water we drink
are often contaminated by the emanations of graves. It cannot be
right that London, for instance, with all its inevitable impurities,
should add to its foulnesses that of trying to live in company with
thousands upon thousands of decaying bodies in its very midst.”</p>

<p class="p1">To dispose of the dead decently, and at the same time
without injury to the living, is one of the first obligations
of civilised communities, and cremation seems
best calculated to fulfil the conditions. Zymotic diseases,
such as typhus, scarlatina, and the plague, have
been traced in certain instances to emanations from
burial-grounds.</p>

<p>Dr. Charles Creighton, in his “History of Epidemics in
Britain,” vol. i., p. 336, says:&mdash;“The grand provocative of
plague was no obvious nuisance above ground, but the
loading of the soil, generation after generation, with an
immense quantity of cadaveric matters, which were
diffused in the pores of the ground under the feet of the
living, to rise in emanations more deadly in one season
than in another.”</p>

<p>It would seem from these experiences as though there
was quite as much truth as poetry in Shakespeare when
he said, “Grave-yards yawn, and hell itself breathes out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
contagion on the world.” Before many years it is not
unlikely that cremation in this as in some other
countries will be made obligatory in cases of death from
all infectious diseases. As the late Bishop of Manchester
observed, “The earth is not for the dead, but for the
living.” During the thirteen years ending 1890 there
were three hundred and three thousand four hundred
and sixty-six deaths from cholera in Japan, and all the
bodies of these persons were cremated. In India, as we
have already shown, cremation is practised under most
of the religious systems, as it is believed that the soul is
not free from its earthly tenement until the body is
reduced to ashes. The method of burning is slow and
cumbersome as compared with that adopted in Europe;
but during the author’s last visit to Ceylon, in the early
part of the present year (1896), there was some talk of
establishing a crematorium.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE LONDON BURIAL-GROUNDS.</div>

<p>In “The London Burial-Grounds,” by Mrs. Basil
Holmes, 1896, p. 269, the question is asked:&mdash;“Are we
ever to allow England to be divided like a chess-board
into towns and burial-places? What we have to consider
is how to dispose of the dead without taking so much
valuable space from the living. In the metropolitan
area alone we have almost filled (and in some places
over-filled) twenty-four new cemeteries within sixty
years, with an area of above six hundred acres; and
this is as nothing compared with the huge extent of
land used for interments just outside the limits of the
metropolis. If the cemeteries are not to extend
indefinitely they must in time be built upon, or they
must be used for burial over and over again, or the
ground must revert to its original state as agricultural<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
land, or we must turn our parks and commons into
cemeteries, and let our cemeteries be our only recreation
grounds, which heaven forbid!”</p>

<p>According to Dr. Ebenezer Duncan eight thousand
bodies are buried yearly in Glasgow and its neighbourhood,
poisoning both air and water, and endangering the
public health. The same state of things has existed in
London, Manchester, Liverpool, Birmingham, and other
large towns. The following resolution was unanimously
adopted in the Preventive Medicine Department of a
Health Congress, Glasgow, in July, 1896:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“That in the opinion of this Congress cremation of the dead,
especially in cases of infectious disease, is a natural and very
desirable hygienic process, and that this Congress of the British
Institute of Public Health use all proper means to urge upon the
Government the desirability of their promoting a measure to
enable sanitary authorities, if they so desire, to build crematoria
and to conduct them under proper superintendence.”</p>

<p class="p1">It must be allowed, however, that cremation, in spite
of its obvious advantages, is not one of those movements
which advance by leaps and bounds. The recent annual
report of the Cremation Society of England states that
during the last year there were two hundred and eight
cremations in the United Kingdom&mdash;viz., one hundred
and fifty at Woking, and fifty-eight at Manchester.
Crematoria have recently been established at Glasgow
and Liverpool.</p>

<p class="pch">WAITING MORTUARIES.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Of</span> all the various methods that have been suggested or
introduced for the prevention of premature interment,
none has been attended with such satisfactory results
as the erection of mortuaries (Leichenhäuser) in Germany.
These structures, described in pp. 294 <i>et seq.</i>, ought to be
provided, as far as practicable, in every parish, and certainly
in every Sanitary District in the United Kingdom,
and by the Boards of Health in the United States, and
adapted to the requirements of the population. They
should be of chaste and elegant design, well ventilated;
their atmosphere made antiseptic with living plants and
flowers, and by plenty of light; provided with baths and
couches, and a skilled attendant&mdash;edifices where both
the dead and the apparent dead can be deposited
pending burial, cremation, or resuscitation. Separate
compartments are necessary for cases where death has
been due to accidents and for those who have succumbed
to infectious diseases. Every modern appliance should
be introduced for the restoration of such as may exhibit
signs of returning consciousness, and of those in whom,
after sufficient time had elapsed, no sign of putrefaction
was observable. The temperature of the room should be
kept at eighty-four degrees, as suggested by Sir Benjamin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
Ward Richardson, and no interment, cremation, <i>post-mortem</i>,
or embalming should be permitted until a
medical examination by one or more experienced physicians
showed unequivocal signs of putrefaction. Perhaps
the Royal Humane Society, which during the last one
hundred and fifty years has done such splendid work
in restoring the drowned and asphyxiated, might be
willing to extend the field of its benevolent operations
to other neglected forms of suspended animation where
intelligent direction and supervision is so much required.</p>

<p>A writer in the <i>British and Foreign Medico-Chirurgical
Review</i>, 1855, vol. xv., p. 75, says:&mdash;“The earliest
movements in the direction of means for the prevention
of premature interments originated with Winslow in
France, followed by other well-known writers upon the
signs of death. It was Madame Necker, however, who
embodied their suggestions in a practicable form as
submitted to the National Assembly, in 1792, by Count
Berchshold. In the ninth year of the first French Republic
(1801) a project was entertained for the erection of six
‘temples funeraires’ in Paris, but came to no good, as
attendant evils preponderated. To Germany belongs
the credit of having executed these designs in such wise
that they should not prove the positive sources of more
danger to the living than could be counter-balanced by
the occasional preservation of an individual from the risk
of premature interment. Believing that this risk had
been prodigiously diminished since the establishment of
these institutions for the reception of cases where doubt
of the reality of death has existed, Hufeland, in Weimar,
devised the plan that Frankfort-on-the-Maine incorporated
with its reform in sepulture and establishment of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
extra-mural cemeteries, in 1823. Hufeland’s plans have
subsequently been adopted and carried out in many
other German States.... As a sanitary measure
the separation of the dead from the living, especially
from among the crowded poor, would be, apart from
the not less important point of verification of death, an
incalculable benefit.... It behoves us in this
matter to learn another lesson from our neighbours,
and to take measures to prevent the occurrence of
catastrophes too fearfully horrible to contemplate in
thought, too dreadful for the most vivid imagination
to realise. Science can hold out no token by which
to recognise the certainty of death. Sanitary police, at
least in England, is indifferent about the risk of a few
burials alive, and thinks it superfluous to prevent their
occurrence.”</p>

<p>That the people have a right to protection by the
State against preventable sources of danger, all civilised
nations have acknowledged, by the making of laws that
guard their citizens from the invasion of diseases of
domestic or foreign origin, as well as many other perils.
<span class="sidenote">THE GERMAN SYSTEM.</span>But the German-speaking countries have gone further
than any other in this humane direction <i>by recognising
apparent death as a special peril to be guarded against by
law</i>, in order to prevent living burials. For this purpose
they have established mortuaries connected with cemeteries,
in which the apparently dead are placed, under
the observation of physicians and attendants. Here the
bodies are placed upon tables, dressed in their ordinary
clothes, amidst light, warmth, and ventilation, surrounded
by plants and floral tributes. Thus they are kept from
forty-eight to seventy-two hours, unless decomposition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
sets in earlier, or the death was due to an infectious
disease. Further delay is allowed on application by the
attending physician, or by some member of the family
interested. Cords connected with an alarm bell are
attached to the fingers, under the conviction that the
least movement of the body would arouse the attendant
in an adjoining room. No doubt these mortuaries have
saved a certain number from being buried alive; but the
system can be improved by extending the observation
until such time as death is certain, for experience shows
that no stated limit of time can apply to all cases
of trance and catalepsy, which are the chief causes of
apparent death. Some of these continue for a week,
and cases of even longer duration are not unknown. It
often happens that returning vital activity consists merely
in scarcely perceptible movements of the eyelids or the
mouth, a change of the complexion, slight moisture on
the face, or a faint action of the heart, or a warmth in
that region, or feeble thoracic movements&mdash;all of which
might escape observation until the allotted time had
expired, and no contrivance, however delicately adjusted,
could announce their presence. Time alone will
test the existence of life or death in such cases.</p>

<p>The extensive literature on this subject shows that the
struggle to bring about the existing mortuary system
in Germany was kept up for many years before it
obtained its measure of success. It was legalised
about the year 1795, after the physicians of Germany,
France, and Austria had shown the absolute
necessity for it.</p>

<p>Mortuaries have continued in high favour with the
people wherever they have once been properly established;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
none, so far as the author has been able to
learn, have ever been abolished. At the present
time the city of Munich is constructing a mortuary at
the Southern cemetery upon a costly scale, surpassing
in sumptuous accessories anything of the kind before
attempted in Germany. It will be not unworthy of
the public buildings of the city. This is an emphatic
endorsement of the necessity of the system by a people
that for more than fifty years has given it a thorough
trial; and it is a strong argument for its adoption
elsewhere.</p>

<p>The question suggests itself here: Why should not the
English-speaking peoples accept the long experience of
a philosophical, painstaking, clear-minded people like
the Germans, supported as it is by many sanitary and
medical authorities in France, England, and the United
States, and establish these institutions in connection
with existing cemeteries, with such modifications as
national habits, local tastes, and customs may dictate?</p>

<p>The following practical suggestions are from a paper
in the <i>Medical Times</i>, vol. xvi., No. 415, p. 574, September
11, 1847, entitled, “On the construction of houses
for the reception of the dead; and on the means to be
used for the recovery of those who are only in trances
or fits, or in whom life is only impassive,” by Robert
Brandon, Esq., Great Russell Street, Bloomsbury:&mdash;</p>

<p class="psh">“<i>DUBIÆ VITÆ REFUGIUM</i>; OR, ASYLUM FOR
DOUBTFUL LIFE.</p>

<div class="sidenote1">ASYLUM FOR DOUBTFUL LIFE.</div>

<p>“The building should be large enough to provide means
for resuscitation, and have room enough for the deposition
of bodies when epidemics are prevalent. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
should be hot baths, for these often are alone enough to
recall the vital spark; and a kitchen to prepare nourishment
for those who are recovered, and for the porter and
other officers who would live on the building. The room
for the deposit of the bodies should communicate with
the porter’s room by means of a glass door, and every
body should have a wire fixed to the feet and hands, in
communication with a bell, which bell must ring in the
porter’s room, in order to warn him should there be any
motion in those thought to be dead. There should be
men and women on the premises to use friction, a
galvanic machine, and the implements necessary for
transfusion and artificial respiration. As the usual and
accepted signs of death are not signs to be relied on, so
is decomposition a true sign, and none should be buried
until this be present; but as the presence of decomposed
animal matter would be injurious, not only to the inmates
of houses, but to the surrounding inhabitants, and as it
is inconvenient to the poor man who has but one room
to keep a body in that room, where he and his family
eat, drink, and sleep, asylums for the reception of those
thought to be dead should be constructed, and are absolutely
necessary. Nor is it enough to wait for decomposition,
but we should endeavour to prevent this by
endeavouring to restore vitality by means of hot baths,
external heat, artificial respiration, galvanism, or transfusion;
the first of these is oftentimes enough. Now, I
think it probable that many persons would be recovered,
thought to be dead, for, out of a number of those
reputed dead, a certain number have recovered&mdash;some
by the sticking of the pins into them which fixed the
shrouds, some under the surgeon’s knife, some from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
delays in the burial, and others from the accidental overturning
of the coffins, as we learn from a paper published
on premature burials. Some time since a woman was
kept above ground for a considerable time, as medical
men could not decide if she were dead or no. And at
Constantinople a sailor the other day was attacked with
apoplexy, and a vein was opened in his arm; no blood
came, and the man was thought to be dead, but on
the road to the grave blood began to flow, and the supposed
dead man recovered. There is now living in
Brussels a man who escaped from the grave; and another
built a house at Cologne to commemorate his escape.
These cases will be enough to show that we have no
certain sign of death but decomposition; and, if this be
true, we must have asylums for the reception of bodies
previous to decomposition, and for the application of
means which can do no harm, and may do much
good, such as those before indicated. Medical men
think that the absence of respiration and want of
heart’s action, with loss of motion and sensation,
are signs of death; but this is not the case, for
many bodies which have been drowned have all these
signs present and yet recover. Again, infants are often
born without any action of the heart or lungs, and yet
are recovered by very simple means, such as the hot bath;
and I myself have recovered persons by stimulants who
were thought to be dead. Many may be recovered by
transfusion (first introduced into this country by the
celebrated Dr. Blundel) when the heart still palpitates,
but the brain is insensible; or by stimulants given at
that period; or by hot bath, and the external application
of heat; by galvanism, where other means have failed;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
and these can do no harm. Since the brain is insensible
there can be no suffering; and many lives will be saved
by perseverance, and the skilful application of means
which have succeeded in isolated cases. Buildings for
the reception of those thought to be dead should be
placed in cemeteries.</p>

<p>“I divide life into active and passive. Life is active
when man is in the enjoyment of all his faculties,
intellectual and moral; when the various organs necessary
for circulation and respiration are in play; when there is
sensation, perception, and motion; and when the
sphincters are not relaxed. Passive life is that state
hitherto called death; but, according to me, death is
decomposition.</p>

<p>“Nor should we despair at any period previous to this,
since we can give motion by galvanism; blood by transfusion;
respiration by artificial respiration; heat by this
and the external application of caloric; and by stimulants
we can keep up that action which has been excited by
other means. Nor must we despair if we do not at once
succeed in our endeavours to recall life, for perseverance
often accomplishes that which at first sight seems
impossible.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MR. ROBERT BRANDON’S SUGGESTIONS.</div>

<p>“Men have recovered from simulated death after being
in the sea twenty minutes, and I see no reason why,
after disease, men may not also be recovered from a state
resembling death. Many who are left as dead are only
in fainting fits, some are in trances; and graves have
been opened where the buried man has been found to
have eaten portions of his own flesh, which of course he
could not have done unless recovery had taken place.
How horrible to think that we may awake up in our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
graves tormented with the pangs of hunger, unable
scarce to breathe, and finding all escape from our narrow
cell impossible; the prisoner in his grave has nought to
do but to commend his soul afresh to his Maker, and
lay himself down to die! May not much of this be prevented
by asylums for doubtful life, by the application
of reagents, and by building vaults in our cemeteries
instead of graves? I earnestly hope that the day has
arrived when we see these things in the proper light;
when our church-yards will be no longer overloaded with
the remains of those who, perhaps, might have lived had
they been left a little longer above ground&mdash;had they
been transfused, or even buried in vaults instead of
graves, with a guardian to watch over their mortal
remains! Life may exist, but not be evident; but the
non-evidence of life is no proof of death, as many have
been recovered in whom life was only latent&mdash;in whom
there was no action of the heart, no respiration, no motion,
no sensation. This has happened after drowning, in infants
born asphyxiated, in women after flooding, and would
happen much more often were the proper means applied in
all cases to recall life, and to ascertain those who may be
recoverable. Simple inspection is not enough to decide
if a man be dead or not, because persons are often only
in trances or fainting fits when they are thought to be
dead; and I wish to insist on the fact that there is no
sign of death but decomposition, and that, therefore, none
should be buried until this sign be present, nor until an
attestation of the presence of decomposition be given by
some surgeon.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">Referring to the universal fear of burying relatives
alive, the <i>Lancet</i>, September 20, 1845, vol. ii., p. 321,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
observed:&mdash;“It is but little use to descant upon an evil
without pointing out a remedy. In Frankfort, Munich,
and in various other towns, houses, properly situated,
have been fitted up for the temporary reception of the
dead. Corpses are there deposited immediately after
death, and taken care of until the signs of decomposition
have become unequivocal, medical assistance being at
hand should symptoms of vitality manifest themselves.
By this simple plan all the objections which attend on
the retention of the dead in the dwellings of the poor
may be obviated, and at the same time their dread of
burying their relatives whilst still alive respected. This
plan is evidently much preferable to that which is
followed in France. In the latter country, in the large
towns, there is in every district a medical inspector of
the dead. The inspector is informed of the death as
soon as it has taken place, and within a very limited
time is bound to inspect the body and give a formal
certificate. This guarantee having been obtained, the
inhumation of the deceased is enforced by law within
two or three days of the death. Notwithstanding this
precaution, cases have occurred, even during the last
few years, which appear to prove that inhumation has
taken place before life was quite extinct. We doubt,
also, whether such early interment could under any
circumstances be enforced in our own country. Some
modification of the German plan is evidently what we
must look for in any system of legislation which may
hereafter be decided on.” These admirable suggestions
from the leading medical journal were made more than
half a century ago; since that time, every year has
brought to light cases of living burial, and confirmed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
the urgent need of reform; but nothing has been done
until quite recently to awaken public attention to their
importance. The subject is of such a gruesome, unpleasant,
and depressing character that few people care
to have their names associated with a movement of this
character, beneficent though it is, and certain to save
thousands of unfortunate people, particularly women and
children (who are more especially liable to various forms
of suspended animation), from such tragic occurrences.</p>

<p>The <i>Undertakers’ and Funeral Directors’ Journal</i>,
August 22, 1895, referring to the fact that in 1892
thirty-one thousand eight hundred and ninety-two
inquests were held in England, and to the urgent
necessity for the erection of mortuaries, says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<div class="sidenote1">EVERYWHERE NEEDED.</div>

<p class="p1">“The bountiful, or private enterprise, should provide these
mortuaries. But once let their necessity be recognised and the
scheme approved,&mdash;fashion leading the way,&mdash;then undertakers
would readily supply what was wanted. If not, then the local
authority should take the initiative. Mortuaries are sadly needed
almost everywhere for present purposes, as newspapers constantly
affirm. In providing them, care should be taken to build with an
eye to future requirements when it shall become customary if not
compulsory to remove the dead from among the living within a
reasonable time after death.</p>

<p>“It is merciful sometimes to be inexorable, and what a lot of
willing and unnecessary discomfort and risk would be saved were
it possible and the practice to find a temporary resting-place for
our departed friends till we are ready to carry them befittingly to
the tomb.”</p></div>

<p class="psh">MORTUARIES OF LONDON.</p>

<p>Each of the sanitary districts in the Metropolis is supposed
to have a mortuary of some kind for the reception
of bodies from hospitals, infirmaries, hotels, private
houses, as well as from the river and streets, or in transit to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
and from foreign countries, where they are kept without
charge for about five days, unless the public health
requires earlier interment. Hospitals, hotels, and
families are thus relieved of the presence of corpses, for
convenience, and for purposes of inquest. The mortuaries
are nearly all plain, gloomy, and depressing structures of
brick. The best of them comprise a coroner’s courtroom,
coroner’s private room, the caretaker’s rooms,
waiting room, <i>post-mortem</i> room, chapel, and viewing
room connected. There is no physician in attendance,
and no autopsies are performed except by surgeons upon
their own cases, or for purposes of inquests. There are
no appliances or conveniences for resuscitation, as all
the bodies are regarded as dead, having been, for the
most part, certified as such by a medical practitioner,
the exceptions being such as are taken from
the water or street by the police, or left there for
inquest. The buildings are usually well lighted, and
some of the rooms contain fire-places, but they are
devoid of taste or ornamentation of any kind. The
bodies are kept in coffins, which, if there is any odour
proceeding from them, are screwed down. Permission is
afforded for inspection by doctors or by any of the family
of the deceased on application to the keeper. These
mortuaries are kept clean, and decent and respectful
treatment of the bodies is enforced by regulations.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE LONDON MORTUARIES.</div>

<p>The London County Council issued a return (No. 157)
dated March 9, 1894, in pursuance of the Public Health
(London) Act, 1891, relating to coroners’ courts, mortuaries,
etc., from which it appears that there were
fifty-one mortuaries in the sanitary districts of London
up to September 30, 1893. In most of these the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
accommodation is described as “sufficient,” “good,”
“well arranged,” “excellent,” “convenient.” Others are
of an opposite character. The one attached to the Town
Hall, Holborn district, is reported as “very small (about
nine feet by nine feet), inconvenient, and badly situated.”
In the Poplar district the mortuary “is an old crypt,
quite unfit for the purpose, and has no convenience for
<i>post-mortems</i>.” At Ratcliffe, in the Limehouse district, the
mortuary “consists of a railway arch, and is very unsuitable.”
“There is a very small mortuary in the
church-yard” at Shadwell. The mortuary under the
church-yard of St. Martin’s Church (St. Martin’s-in-the-Fields)
is reported “very imperfect.” The one in the
Southern Coroner’s district is situated under a railway
arch, and there is no mortuary-keeper. At St. Paul’s,
Deptford, the mortuary contains only one room, which
serves for mortuary and <i>post-mortem</i> room. Plumstead
is possessed of an underground mortuary in the
church-yard, reported as “unsatisfactory.” The Lewisham
district has an “unsuitable” mortuary at the
cemetery. Rotherhithe has “an inadequate mortuary in
the old burial-ground.” At St. George the Martyr
(Southwark) the mortuary is reported to be “inadequate
and unsuitable.” In the Strand district there is “no
proper mortuary, but a small dead-house attached to
the Savoy Chapel is used.” Eltham, Lea, and Kidbrooke,
in the Plumstead district, have no mortuaries. The
part of Lambeth, S. and S.E., up the Clapham and
Kennington Park roads, is without a mortuary, and
<i>bodies awaiting inquest are kept in private houses</i>. Nor
are there any mortuaries in the Greenwich district
(Hatcham), Wapping, or Mile End Old Town. Arrangements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
are reported to be in progress for the enlargement
of some of these establishments and the erection of
others.</p>

<p>No resuscitations are reported from any of these places,
except in the case of Ernest Wicks, a boy two years old,
who was found lying on the grass in Regent’s Park
apparently dead, and resuscitated in St. Marylebone
Mortuary (after being laid out on a slab as dead) in
September, 1895, by the keeper, Mr. Ellis, assisted by
Mrs. Ellis. When the doctor arrived, the child was
breathing freely, though still insensible. The child was
taken to the Middlesex Hospital, and was reported by
the surgeon to be recovering from a fit.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HOSPITAL MORTUARIES.</div>

<p>The London mortuaries stand well in the estimation
of the authorities, medical practitioners, and the people,
on account of their usefulness and convenience in relieving
hotels and private houses of the dead pending
funerals, and in cases of deaths from infectious diseases,
as well as from accidents and acts of violence (amongst
which suicides are included) which require investigation.
In consequence of this, there is a disposition on the part
of the authorities to enlarge and improve the older and
smaller ones, and to introduce the later conveniences.
Those in St. Marylebone and St. Luke’s are the latest
examples, and could, with comparatively little outlay,
be rendered creditable and useful establishments.
First of all, they require the means of resuscitation,
such as are in use at the Royal Humane Societies’
Depôts, and at the German mortuaries; also baths,
couches, plants, flowers, and mural ornaments, with
a skilled nurse or caretaker, and a medical practitioner
either on the establishment or within telephone call.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
A fundamental regulation should be added to the
standing orders that, when there is no sign of decomposition,
bodies should be treated not as dead but as
sick needing attention, and to be kept under careful
observation. Such simple and inexpensive alterations,
gradually introduced by County, Parish, and District
Councils, would, in the course of time, bring about a
greater respect for the dead, with proper consideration
for the apparently dead, besides increasing the feeling of
the sanctity of human life. In the course of time these
improvements would educate the public, and lead to the
erection of new and handsome structures of beautiful
design, with appropriate artistic decorations, such as are
to be found in Munich and other parts of Germany.</p>

<p>The <i>Medical Times</i>, September 5, 1896, p. 569,
says:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“In a recent issue of the <i>Nursing Record</i>, there is an interesting
article on hospital mortuaries by a special commissioner.... At
Guy’s the mortuary only contains room for one body. There is a
bier, covered by a cradle and a red and white washing pall, and
over this is a shelf, on which are placed a cross, fresh flowers, and
candles. At St. Bartholomew’s the mortuary itself is certainly not
a place where one would care to find one’s dead. The bare, white-washed
walls, the sloping floor, the black lidless shells, covered by
white sheets, would depress most people even if they had no special
interest in them. That this is felt to some extent by the hospital
authorities is evident from the fact that, when a member of the
staff dies, they do their best to make other arrangements for the
disposal of the body until it is removed from the hospital. There
is an hospital not named [continues the <i>Medical Times</i>] where the
only place available as a mortuary is the wash-house. It would
appear that the managers of metropolitan hospitals do not believe
in the reality of death-counterfeits, and therefore make no arrangements
for resuscitation.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>

<p class="psh">MORTUARIES IN THE PROVINCES.</p>

<p>With the object of ascertaining the utility of these
establishments, the author wrote to the clerks or other
officials in all the larger towns in the United Kingdom,
fifty in number, requesting copies of the regulations,
reports, etc. To these communications twenty-four
replies were received. Of these, only three sent copies
of reports, furnishing particulars of the number of
bodies received, and the number of inquests and <i>post-mortems</i>;
three sent copies of regulations; and the
remainder do not publish either reports or regulations.
One, however (Poplar), states that the by-laws in use are
approved by the Local Government Board. The Chief
Constable at the Town Hall, Salford, writes, July 26,
1896&mdash;“There are three mortuaries in the borough, but
a separate record of the bodies laid in the mortuaries is
not kept, and no papers exist respecting them.” Mr.
Hagger, the Vestry Clerk of the Parish of Liverpool,
says&mdash;“I know of no public mortuary in Liverpool
which is considered to be of such importance as to call
for anything in the shape of periodical reports.” Mr.
R. Davidson, Governor of the City Parish Poorhouse,
Glasgow, writes, July 27, 1896&mdash;“I have never had any
reports relating to the mortuary here.” Mr. J. Jackson,
Chief Constable, Sheffield, writes, July 29&mdash;“We have
never had papers or reports connected with it (the
mortuary), except the ordinary rules and regulations for
preserving decency, cleanliness, etc.” Similar replies
were received from Manchester, Swansea, Scarborough,
Wigan, Bristol, St. Mary’s (Islington), Dundee, and
Catford. Mr. Robert Clinton, Master of the Bethnal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
Green Workhouse, writes, July 30&mdash;“That their mortuary
has not been the subject of any reports,” and
continues, “The subject of persons being buried alive
is a very important one, and should arouse the interest
of every intelligent person. Some method ought
certainly to be devised that will prevent anyone being
subjected to so horrible a fate.”</p>

<p class="psh">IRELAND.</p>

<p>The following extracts are from the report by Dr.
J. E. Kenny, M.P., Coroner for the City of Dublin,
received in January, 1894:&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote">BURIAL CUSTOMS IN IRELAND.</div>

<p>“There are no local laws in Dublin or in Ireland
relative to the mode of disposal of the dead, but the
Sanitary Acts, which refer to the United Kingdom of
Great Britain and Ireland, can be availed of when necessary
to compel the burial of the dead within a reasonable
period, on the ground that an unburied body is a nuisance
dangerous to public health. There is, however, no fixed
period. Among Roman Catholics it is customary to
bury the dead on the third or fourth day after death,
but there is no hard-and-fast rule.... The local
burial authorities usually require a medical certificate of
death before opening the grave, but there is no legal
sanction for this, and it is merely the custom. The
coroner’s order for burial where an inquest is held does
away with the necessity of such certificates as those
above referred to, but <i>post-mortem</i> examinations in these
cases are the exception, not the rule. A good many,
however, are held on those who die in local hospitals
when the consent of the relatives or friends can be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
obtained. I have not heard of any case of cremation
in Ireland, and earth-burial is the universal practice.
Occasionally, when so ordered by the will of the
deceased, a body is removed to England for cremation.
I am myself rather in favour of cremation as
a more scientific and safer method of disposing of the
dead.</p>

<p>“There are no chambers (mortuaries) of the kind
referred to in this question in Dublin, nor, so far as I
know, in Ireland. I know of no law as to the signs of
death which must be recognised to exist before burial
is permitted, nor is there any officer on whom is thrown
the duty of ascertaining or deciding whether such exist
or not.</p>

<div class="sidenote">REFORMS URGENTLY NEEDED.</div>

<p>“If cremation be generally adopted, it ought not to
be performed earlier than the third day after death, or
perhaps not until some unmistakable sign of decomposition
has set in. I think this rule of some such sign
of decomposition setting in ought to apply to all methods
of disposal of the dead. Whenever well-marked warmth
of the body exists after apparent death, burial of any
kind ought not to take place until after a full and
exhaustive examination by a competent authority. In
all doubtful cases I would suggest the application of
either a hot iron to some sensitive part of the body, or
that a small incision should be made over the course of
some small artery, a person being left to watch the
result for some time in the latter case, so as to take
proper precautions against hæmorrhage, should the
person be not really dead. It might perhaps with
advantage be made the law that in every case of death
or supposed death the body should be viewed by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
medical man, who, having satisfied himself that death
had taken place, would sign a certificate to that effect.
If I understand rightly, such is the law in France. I
would, however, be opposed to any law making an
autopsy necessary in every case. The existence of such
a public officer as a coroner is undoubtedly of advantage
in reference to cases of sudden death or supposed death,
as it is among such cases that mistakes are most likely
to occur. I can see no objection to the establishment,
at the public expense, of chambers for the reception of
dead bodies under certain circumstances.”</p>

<p>In reply to a similar inquiry Sir Charles A. Cameron,
Superintendent Medical Officer of Health, writes,
August 10, 1896&mdash;“There is no public mortuary in
Dublin, but we are taking steps for the establishment
of one.”</p>

<p>It need hardly be said that the mortuaries described in
these reports have little in common with certain <i>Leichenhäuser</i>
of Germany or the <i>Mortuaires d’ Attente</i> urgently
called for by various writers of France, and proposed to be
erected. The English mortuaries may more appropriately
be described as <i>morgues</i> or depositories for the homeless
and neglected dead&mdash;useful for this purpose, but in no
respect fulfilling the requirements of the present day.
Without skilful attendants and scientific appliances for
the restoration of suspended life, to which all are liable,
the apparently dead, if deposited in such chilling establishments,
would, through neglect, be more likely to lose
what spark of life remained than to have it kindled into
a flame and recover. The erection of mortuaries for the
sake of death-counterfeits, and in order to give peace
of mind to doubting friends, would no doubt be opposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
chiefly on the ground of expense. The outlay must
come from the pockets of the rate-payers, who have been
accustomed to accept the cursory inspection of “the
corpse” and the certificate of the doctor as a satisfactory
solution of any misgivings as to the actuality of death.
Under the circumstances it would not be surprising if the
unreflecting majority preferred to take what they would
consider to be an infinitesimal risk rather than to incur
the expense of the necessary outlay. This volume has
been written to remove such apathy, and, if possible, to
arouse public attention to the subject; and if the facts are,
as the author believes, absolutely true, and the danger
real, other and abler contributions furnishing the results
of wider and more extensive investigations may be
expected to follow. It is believed that the expense of
constructing tastefully designed mortuaries in all populous
districts could be met by a rate of from a farthing to
a penny in the pound, and in the smaller or thinly
populated districts groups of parishes could unite in
providing such useful institutions. At present, under
existing customs, probably ten times the amount required
is annually expended in funeral trappings, mourning
habiliments, costly wreaths, and ornamental monuments
(mainly for the purpose of ostentatious display)
than would provide temporary resting-places for the
real and apparently dead in every part of the United
Kingdom. The erection of such establishments, where
the fact of death in every case could be unequivocally
demonstrated before burial or cremation, would remove
an ever present and consuming load of anxiety from
the hearts of thousands of sensitive souls.</p>

<p class="psh">CONTINENTAL MORTUARIES.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CONTINENTAL MORTUARIES.</div>

<p>The author is indebted to a “Treatise on Public
Health,” by Albert Palemberg and A. Newsholme,
London, 1893, for the following details:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="pc1">BRUSSELS.</p>

<p>“This city possesses two mortuaries to which bodies are conveyed
from confined houses. One of these, within the town, only
receives the bodies of persons not having died of an infectious
disease; all others are conveyed to the mortuary at the Evère
Cemetery....</p>

<p>“In times of epidemic the removal of corpses to the mortuary
is compulsory, and so also in other cases where the medical health
officer decides that it is necessary. No corpse, without special
permission, can be kept in the mortuary more than forty-eight
hours after death, but this interval can be shortened or lengthened
by special order.”</p>

<p class="pc1">PARIS.</p>

<p>“By a decision of July 21, 1890, the Municipal Council of Paris
has decided to establish a mortuary in each of the cemeteries of
the east (Père La Chaise) and the north (Montmartre)....
The mortuaries are not available for the bodies of persons having
died from infectious disease.</p>

<p>“Bodies are only admitted to the mortuary&mdash;(1) On the written
application of the head of the family or some other persons competent
to undertake the funeral. (2) On the production of a
certificate of death from the doctor who attended the patient,
stating that the death was not caused by infectious disease.</p>

<p>“Up to the present time (1893) these mortuaries do not appear
to have been of great service, owing to the unwillingness of families
to part with their dead before the time of interment.</p>

<p>“‘La Morgue.’&mdash;This establishment only receives bodies on
which a <i>post-mortem</i> examination is required, and the bodies of
unknown persons, placed there for recognition. In the hall where
the bodies are exposed, the temperature is kept several degrees
below zero by a system of refrigeration, thus retarding putrefaction.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
This system would, in consequence of the low temperature, greatly
retard or prevent the revival of persons who may only be in a state
of torpidity from submergence, or of trance or catalepsy, who could
be resuscitated if warmth and other proper means were promptly
applied to them.”</p>

<p class="pc1">BERLIN.</p>

<p>“In some of the cemeteries mortuaries have been built, which are
placed at the disposal of the public by the authorities, with the
understanding that the corpses shall be taken from them as soon
as possible.</p>

<p>“The bodies of the poor are first placed in the depository
of the old cemeteries, within the city enclosure, whence they are
removed by night in carriages kept for the purpose to the
mortuary in the large cemetery outside the city, to be buried the
next day. The Jews have built a mortuary chapel in their new
cemetery at Weissensee, which fulfils all the conditions required
by modern hygiene, and contains everything necessary for washing,
isolating, and enveloping the bodies.</p>

<p>“A new establishment, which answers its purpose perfectly, has
been built in the old cemetery&mdash;Charité&mdash;and is used for inquests,
<i>post-mortem</i> examinations, etc., also for the exhibition of bodies of
unknown persons. The bodies are preserved from putrefaction by
an apparatus in which refrigeration is produced by ammonia and
chloride of calcium, as the Morgue in Paris.”</p>

<p class="pc1">VIENNA.</p>

<p>“There is a mortuary in each district of the city to which are
brought corpses belonging to families who have imperfect accommodations.</p>

<p>“The district doctor must decide whether removal is necessary,
as it is his duty to register deaths and their causes. He should at
the same time examine into the state of the dwelling from a
sanitary standpoint.</p>

<p>“In cases of sudden death, and when the cause of death is not
apparent, a <i>post-mortem</i> examination must be made.</p>

<p>“The bodies of persons who have died from infectious disease
must not be taken to the common mortuaries, but to one built in
the common cemetery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span></p>

<p>“Bodies must not be buried in the city. The principal cemetery
is at Kaiser-Ebersdorf, north-west of the city, and cost four millions
of marks.”</p>

<p class="pc1">STOCKHOLM.</p>

<p>“Every parish possesses a mortuary vault. According to the
regulations of the Health Commission, bodies must not remain
there more than forty-eight hours in the hot season, and seventy-two
in the cold weather.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">The first modern mortuary was opened at Weimar,
Germany, in 1791.</p>

<p>In a “Handbook for Travellers in Europe” for 1890,
by W. Pembroke Fetridge, p. 622, is the following description
of the model mortuary in Weimar:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq">“The New Church-yard is a sweet place of its kind. Here may
be seen an admirable arrangement to prevent premature burials in
cases of suspended animation. In a dark chamber, lighted with a
small lamp, the body lies in a coffin. In its fingers are placed
strings, which communicate with an alarm clock; the least pulsation
of the corpse will ring the bell in an adjoining chamber, where
a person is placed to watch, when a medical attendant is at once
supplied. There have been several cases where persons supposed
to be dead were thus saved from premature burial.”</p>

<p class="p1">The <i>Middlesborough Gazette</i> of 11th October, 1895,
says:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“Those who have visited burying grounds in some parts of the
South of England are well aware that tombs made in the shape of
‘waiting rooms’ are largely in vogue with the well-to-do classes.
One in a little church-yard in Sussex was elegantly fitted up. The
coffins were placed on one side of the well-lighted vault, while on
the opposite side was a couch, chairs, and a table, together with
books. The relatives of the deceased&mdash;eccentric they may have
been, we are not prepared to say&mdash;visited the vault, access to which
was gained by a flight of steps, and there passed much of their
time in reading, the ladies doing needle work. But this sort of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
thing is only for the rich. The poor must be protected from being
buried alive by other and more economical methods&mdash;namely, by
stricter attention to the actual and unmistakable evidences of
death, and by careful registration on medical certificates only.”</p>

<p class="p1">It would appear by the following announcement, that
an effort is being made to supply one of the several
properly fitted mortuaries needed in the French
capital:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“The <i>Pall Mall Gazette</i> of September 21, 1895, announces a
decided novelty in the way of limited liability companies&mdash;the
Mortuary Waiting-room Company, which, it says, is on the point of
being floated in the French capital. Our contemporary says that
the amount for subscription is stated to be £20,000, and dividends
at the rate of at least 100 per cent. may, it is claimed, be confidently
looked for. The company undertake to provide separate waiting-rooms,
of two classes, in a large mortuary building. The alleged
corpse will be comfortably deposited there upon a couch, and carefully
looked after till the fact that it is a corpse shall have been
established beyond question. The waiting-rooms will be tastefully
decorated, with everything about them to welcome the revived
tenant agreeably back to life. It is interesting to hear that no
shareholder’s heirs will be allowed to visit him.”</p>

<p class="p1">Some sanitarians and funeral reformers urge with
much reason that the presence of the dead should not be
allowed to endanger the health of the living, and recommend
that if death has occurred from infectious
disease, the body should be covered with charcoal and
conveyed at once to a mortuary chamber; and others
advise early burials for all as soon as possible. If, however,
this volume has not demonstrated the danger of
such early burials, except where decay of the earthly
vesture is visible, it will have been written in vain.</p>

<p>The following recommendation from a well-known
physician and surgeon appears in <i>London</i>, p. 613, September
27, 1894:&mdash;</p>

Congress at Buda Pesth, by W. J. Collins, M.D., M.S., B.Sc., D.P.H.

<p>“I therefore hold that every inducement should be held out to
the poor by local authorities, by the provision of decent, suitable,
and attractive mortuaries, to allow their dead to be removed from
danger to the living to a place where sentiment shall be respected
and sanitation satisfied.”</p></div>

<p class="psh">THE UTILITY OF MORTUARIES.</p>

<p>During the discussion on Premature Burials in the
press, the erection of mortuaries (chambres mortuaires
d’attente) has been objected to (1) on the ground of
expense to the rate-payers; and (2) because the results
by way of resuscitation of those constructed in Germany
have not justified the cost of their erection and maintenance,
and that if they had not already been in existence
they would not now, it is said, be established. The
most recent investigations on this subject have been
made by Monsieur B. Gaubert, the results of which
appear in his work, “Les Chambres Mortuaires
d’Attente,” a volume of 308 pages, published in Paris,
1895. The author shows by the citation of facts that
both in France and Germany numerous cases of resuscitation
of persons certified as dead, and deposited in
mortuaries, in spite of many drawbacks connected with
their management, have occurred, and that their continuance
is amply justified on the ground of utility. In
the report of the Municipal Council of Paris for 1880,
No. 174, p. 84, is a letter from <span class="sidenote">THE MAYOR OF MUNICH’S OPINION.</span> Herr Ehrhart, Mayor of
Munich, May 2, 1880, who says:&mdash;“The lengthy period
during which these establishments have been utilised, the
order which has always prevailed, the manner in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
the remains are disposed and adorned, <i>the resuscitation
of some who were believed to be dead</i>, have all contributed
to remove any sentimental objections to these establishments.
The bodies are transported to the Leichenhäuser
twelve hours after death, without the least opposition on
the part of the relatives.” The expense of these institutions
would, no doubt, in the aggregate be a considerable
sum, but not nearly so large as that voted for the
erection and maintenance of public libraries, now so
common; but in the presence of so serious and real a
danger as that of living burial, to which any of us is
liable, it is hardly worth considering. For peace of mind
the cost of such insurance would be cheerfully paid by
thousands, and ought to be provided for the poor and
for those who would in time come to value it. This is
a matter that might appropriately be taken up by the
County, District, and Parish Councils and Boards of
Guardians, under the powers granted to them by the
Local Government Act of 1894.</p>

<p>Dr. Josat, in his treatise “De la mort et de ses
caractères,” shows by numerous arguments and examples
that, as there is an interval or condition provided
by nature between disease and health known as <i>convalescence</i>,
and the transition between the one and the other
is preceded by a variety of phenomena known as a <i>crisis</i>,
so there is an interval between the termination of a fatal
malady and real death (erroneously described as the
agony), the symptoms which denote intermediate or
apparent death. But while the result of an error may be
of little moment in the first case, it may in the other
become disastrous, by abandoning the dying before
absolute death. It is during this interval, between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
(so called) death agony and absolute death, which
sometimes has been known to last a week, that the
transfer to a suitable mortuary should be made.</p>

<p>The following may be cited as typical illustrations
of the utility of mortuaries in discovering the existence
of life after apparent death.</p>



<p>H. L. Kerthomas in “Dernières Considérations sur les
Inhumations Précipitées,” Lille, 1852, p. 17, relates that&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<div class="sidenote1">AND CASES OF RESUSCITATION.</div>

<p class="p1">“At a hospital in Liege two house-surgeons were at the ‘Salles
des décades’ in pursuance of their anatomical studies, when hearing
at one side of them a noise like stifled breathing great was
their fear! Still they coolly finished their examination, and then
discovered the supposed corpse moving convulsively amongst his
dead companions; but, thanks to efficient help, he was completely
restored to health.” (The above occurred in 1847.)</p>

<p class="p1">M.B. Gaubert, in “Les Chambres Mortuaires d’Attente,”
records the six following cases:&mdash;“On the 25th of January,
1849, the <i>Journal des Débats</i> recorded a fact somewhat
similar to that which lately disturbed the town of
Perigueux:&mdash;</p></div>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="pc1">“‘MUNICH.</p>

<p>“‘A young man who was asphyxiated by charcoal had been
declared dead by the doctor. After they had been watching the
body twenty-four hours at the mortuary chamber, the family caused
it to be carried to the church, where it passed the night without the
customary caretaker. The next morning “the corpse” was found
bathed in its own blood, and the floor of the church was stained.
Restored to consciousness during the night and not having any
help, the poor young man had succumbed to hæmorrhage, brought
on by the incisions which they blindly practised on the body of the
supposed dead one to make sure of his death.’</p>

<p>“‘The mother of a family had just lost her child, aged five years.
She carried to the Leichenhäuser a heart broken by grief, cherishing
the vague hope in the depth of her love that this separation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
would not be the last. According to habit the families of Munich
exposed the corpse in a mortuary chamber amidst flowers and
trees, and surrounded by a circle of light. The Leichenhäus
then appeared to have lost its habitual funereal character&mdash;for it
had quite a festive air. The poor mother passed the night amidst
tears and prayers, waiting with anxiety and hoping for the arrival
of the good news. The next morning a workman of the Leichenhäuser
knocked at the door of the house with a large bundle which
he carried in his arms; a few seconds after, the mother pressed to
her heart the resuscitated child which she was told she had just
lost. The transports of joy she experienced were so great that she
fell down dead. The child had come to life in the mortuary by
himself, and, when the keeper saw it, it was playing with the white
roses which had been placed on its shroud.’ (P. 179.)</p></div>

<p class="p1">“The same recent writer quotes the following on the
testimony of the surgeons Louis and Junker:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="pc1">“‘SALTPÉTRIÈRE.</p>

<p>“‘A young country girl,’ said Surgeon Louis, ‘strong and
vigorous, twenty-five years old, left on foot from the Hotel Dieu,
Paris, where she had been resting the night before, and came to
Saltpétrière. The fatigue of the journey induced an attack of
syncope on her arrival. They put her on the bed, and with
cordials and warmth she revived, but at the end of an hour she
had another attack. They thought she was dead, and carried her
to the mortuary. After leaving the body&mdash;it had remained there
some time&mdash;they carried it to the amphitheatre. The next morning
a young surgeon said he had heard plaintive cries in the
amphitheatre, and his fear had prevented him from coming to
tell me. I went into the amphitheatre, and saw with sorrow
that the poor girl, who had vainly struggled to free herself from
the sheet which enveloped her, was now quite dead. She had one
leg on the floor, and an arm on the seat of the trestle of a dissecting
table. I here recall the feelings of horror with which I was
agitated on this occasion. I doubt if there ever was a sadder or
more touching spectacle than this.’ (P. 187.)</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span></p>

<p class="pc1">“BERLIN.</p>

<p>“‘A Berlin apothecary wrote to me lately’ (says Dr.
Lénormand) ‘in this town to the effect that during an
interval of two years and a-half, ten people stated to be
dead had been recalled to life. I shall quote only the
following:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="pc1">“‘SOLDIER OF THE GUARD.</p>

<p>“‘In the middle of the night the bell of the vestibule rang
violently. The caretaker, who had only entered on duties within
a few days, much startled, ran towards the mortuary. As soon as
he opened the door he found himself confronted with one of “the
corpses” enveloped in his shroud who had quitted his bier and
was making his way out. He was a soldier of the guard believed
to be dead, and he was able to join his regiment five days later.’
(<i>Ibid.</i>, p. 180.)</p></div>

<p class="psh">“FRANKFORT-ON-THE-MAINE.</p>

<p>“Dr. Josat said that during his sojourn in Germany,
Herr Schmill, director of the mortuary at Frankfort,
related to him a case of apparent death which occurred
under his own eyes.</p>

<p class="pbq p1">“‘In the year 1840, a girl of nineteen years died of acute
pleuro-pneumonia. Her body, during very hot weather, was exposed
in the mortuary for a period of eight days in a state of perfect
preservation. Her face retained its colour, the limbs were supple,
and the substance of the cornea transparent, whereas in ordinary
cases decomposition shows itself on the third day. The parents
could not reconcile themselves to have their daughter buried, and
found themselves much troubled. Finally on the ninth day the
supposed dead suddenly awoke without any premonitory indications
of life.’ (<i>Ibid.</i>, p. 180.)</p>

<p class="pc1">“BELGIUM.</p>

<p>“There was a case at Brussels in January, 1867, of a
person who returned to life just as the bearers arrived
at the mortuary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span></p>

<p class="pbq p1">“‘A workman of the suburbs, employed by a firm of carriers, fell
ill, and in a few days died. This suddenness of the death caused
doubts as to its reality, and after the usual delay he was taken to
the mortuary connected with the cemetery. The body was left for
a few days’ observation. As soon as they arrived a noise escaped
from the coffin, and arrested the attention of the people present.
At once they hastened towards the coffin, and tried to restore him,
and in a short time he came to life. The same evening he was
able to return to his home. On the following day he went himself
to the authorities to annul the record of his supposed death.’”
(P. 182.)</p>

<p class="p1">M. Gaubert continues:&mdash;“We have collected in Germany
fourteen cases of apparent death followed by
return to life in mortuaries, in spite of all that has been
done for the prevention of such occurrences.” (P. 182.)</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="pc1">CASSEL.</p>

<p>“Dr. E. Bouchut, in ‘Signes de la Mort,’ 3rd edition, p. 50,
relates that an apothecary’s assistant had an attack of syncope,
which continued for eight days, when he was apparently dead,
and was removed to the mortuary of the Military Hospital, Cassel,
where he was covered with a coarse wrapper and left amongst the
dead. The following night he awoke from his lethargy, and, on
recognising the horrible place where he was, dragged himself to the
door and kicked against it. The noise was heard by the sentinel,
aid arrived, and the patient was put in a warm bed, where he recovered.
Dr. Bouchut says that, if he had been swathed in tight
bandages, his efforts at release would have been futile, and he
would have been buried alive.”</p></div>

<p class="pc1">LILLE.</p>

<p>The Paris <i>Figaro</i>, March 31, 1894, on the authority
of the <i>Progrés du Nord</i>, April 2, 1894, reports that:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pc1">“M. Vangiesen, aged eighty-one years, awakened from supposed
death on the flagstones of the mortuary at the Charité Hospital at
Lille.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>Undertakers’ Review</i>, January 22, 1894, reports that
Lena Fellows, aged twenty-two years, a servant in the
employ of A. R. Knox, of Buffalo, fell dead, as was
thought, while at work on December 8. The remains
were taken to the morgue in a coffin, but next morning
when morgue-keeper McShane began to lift the supposed
corpse into the refrigerator he found that the woman
was alive. It was a case of catalepsy.</p>

<p>The case of a child found apparently dead in Regents’
Park, London, and carried to the Marylebone Mortuary,
where it subsequently revived, has already been noticed.
The incident caused a good deal of comment, and
suggested, doubtless, to the reflective reader that other
cases of suspended animation might have a less fortunate
issue.</p>

<div class="sidenote">NEED OF CAREFUL SUPERVISION.</div>

<p>It is quite impossible on the Continent for an enquirer,
as the author knows from experience, to obtain reliable
information with regard to what takes place within the
walls of mortuaries, because of the numerous officials and
others who are interested in covering up any errors of
previous death-certification that may come to light in
them. These comprise the health authorities, and the
police in places where the latter regulate funerals, as well
as the physicians, whose credit is at stake, and the
nurses and undertakers. In many districts in Germany
the original object of the mortuaries&mdash;the prevention of
premature burial&mdash;advocated by Hufeland and others,
has not been kept in view, but the edifices have rather
been used for the convenience of the undertakers and
their assistants, the bodies in many cases being removed
before actual dissolution was established by evidence
of putrefaction. This will need to be guarded against
by more careful supervision.</p>

<p class="pch">CONCLUSION.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is universally admitted that nothing is less certain
than life; and if the reader will weigh the facts, which it
has been the authors’ intention to understate rather than
overstate, he will rightly conclude that nothing is more
uncertain than the signs which are ordinarily accepted
as indicating death. It would have been easy to fill a
much larger volume than this with reports of authentic
cases of premature burial, and narrow escapes from such
terrible mischances, and with more detailed results of the
authors’ researches on the subject in various parts of
Europe and America, as well as in the East. The cases
adduced to illustrate the text are, however, presented as
types of hundreds of others obtainable from equally
reputable sources, and to be found in the works of
various trustworthy authorities, the titles of which can
be seen in the Bibliography at the end of this volume.</p>

<p>The <i>London Review</i> for July, 1791, p. 40, referring to
“An Essay on Vital Suspension: Being an Attempt to
Investigate and Ascertain those Diseases in which the
Principles of Life are Apparently Extinguished,” by a
Medical Practitioner&mdash;observes, that this is one of
many publications “written by physicians and surgeons,
versed in medical science, and well skilled in anatomy,
to demonstrate, beyond a possibility of contradiction,
that there are many cases in which the human body has
the appearance of death, and preserves it for a considerable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
time, without the reality; the vital principle being
still unsubdued, and a restoration of all its powers and
functions practicable by the administration, in due time,
of proper means.” The author of the pamphlet under
review says, “It is a proof of the temerity and imbecility
of human judgment, that we have too many instances
on record, wherein even the most skilful physicians have
erred in the decisions they have pronounced respecting
the extinction of life.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">IMBECILITY OF HUMAN JUDGMENT.</div>

<p>Unfortunately, we appear to be no nearer the prevention
of these terrible mistakes now than we were when
the reviewer called attention to them a century ago.
The imbecility of human judgment complained of
exists now in an unmitigated degree. The appearance
of death is generally taken for its reality: and the
great mass of the inhabitants of this planet are hurried
to their graves without (except in a comparatively few
cases of drowning or poisoning) the application of any
serious efforts at restoration, and without waiting for
unequivocal signs of dissolution.</p>

<p>Whether the risks of being buried alive are as great as
those declared by some of the authorities quoted in this
volume, must be left to the reader to determine for himself;
but that they are considerable there appears little
room for doubt by those who have taken the trouble to
inquire into the facts. How often is the reader shocked
by reading narratives in his daily or weekly newspaper
of persons either buried alive, or of those in a state of suspended
animation, but diagnosed and duly certificated by
the attending doctor as dead, who have returned to consciousness
during the funeral rites or at the grave itself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>Lancet</i> has borne frequent testimony to these
disasters, some of which are quoted in this volume; and,
just as we are writing the closing chapter, the leading
medical journal, in its issue of September 12, 1896,
p. 785, records the following from its Cork correspondent
as having occurred at Little Island, Ireland, which,
the writer says, is thoroughly vouched for:&mdash;</p>

<p>“A child of four years of age contracted (typhoid)
fever, and to all ordinary appearances died. The time
of the funeral was appointed, and friends were actually
on their way to attend it. When the supposed corpse
was about to be removed from the bed to the coffin,
signs of animation were exhibited. The services of the
medical man were again requisitioned, and the child,
opportunely rescued from such a terrible death, is now
progressing satisfactorily.”</p>

<p>Amongst the headings of paragraphs taken from
recent papers lying before me are the following:&mdash;“Buried
Alive,” “A Gruesome Narrative,” “Restored to
Life in a Mortuary,” “Premature Burial,” “The Dead
Alive,” “Buried Alive,” “Sounds from Another Coffin,”
“Mistaken for Dead,” “A Lady Nearly Buried Alive,”
“Revivification After Burial,” “A Woman’s Awful
Experience,” “Bolt Upright in His Coffin,” “Almost
Buried while Alive,” “A Woman Buried Alive,” “The
Corpse Sat Up,” “Alive in Her Coffin,” “Seemed to
Rise from Death,” “Escaped Burial Alive,” “Revival

the Coffin,” “Corpse Seems to Live,” “The Corpse
Moved,” etc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span></p>

<p>According to the “London Manual and Municipal
Year Book,” 1896-97, there are over four hundred public
authorities at work in governing London, who spend
over twelve million pounds a year, and from other
sources it is said that seven millions a year are collected
in the Metropolis for charitable purposes, and yet there
are no officials, associations, or insurance companies to
safeguard the people either in this wealthy Metropolis
or in any part of the United Kingdom against one of
the most terrible physical calamities that can overtake
any member of the human family.</p>

<div class="sidenote">EXPECTATIONS OF LIFE.</div>

<p>The Registrar-General’s Decennial Supplement for
1881-90, published this year (1896), includes a “Life
Table” furnishing the expectations of life in England
and Wales. It appears that the death-rate has fallen
from 21.3 in the decade ending 1880 to 19.0 per
thousand living in that ending 1890. The expectation
of life at birth, according to the actuary’s standard
in the decade 1871-80, was 41.3 years for males, and
44.6 years for females. This has been increased,
as shown in the “Life Table” 1881-90, to 43.6 for
males, and 47.2 for females, mainly through sanitary
amelioration. A perceptible increase, the author believes,
could be shown if steps were taken to restore still-born
children, who constitute about five per cent. of births,
and if the same trouble were adopted to restore the
apparently dead from other diseases (which are sometimes
only crises of repose after wasting disease) as is
generally taken with respect to those accidentally
poisoned or drowned. Besides reducing the mortality
and increasing the expectation of life, such a reform
would greatly diminish the appalling suffering of those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
who, through our apathy and ignorance, are, under our
present system of <i>laissez faire</i>, consigned to precipitate
interment, and would bring tranquillity of mind to those
who are haunted all their lives through fear of such
a catastrophe. Why we should limit our efforts at
restoration of those apparently dead to a few cases has
never been shown, and is surely a serious oversight,
which should be remedied without delay.</p>

<p>Dr. Hartmann, in “Premature Burial,” observes&mdash;“As
by cleaning a dusty watch the watchmaker causes the
hindrances to be removed which prevented the energy
stored up in the watch from setting the clockwork in
motion, so, in cases of apparent death from catalepsy,
asphyxia, syncope, and other diseases causing obstacles
to the manifestation of the life-energy in the body, these
obstacles may be removed by appropriate means, such
as are known to many intelligent physicians, and the
energy of life being latent in the physical form may be
enabled to manifest itself again when the harmony of
the organism has been sufficiently restored, even after
the heart has entirely ceased to beat.”</p>

<p>Dr. A. Fothergill says:&mdash;“Since no one, from prince to
peasant, can at all times be secure from these dreadful
disasters, which suddenly suspend vital action; and
since medical practitioners themselves are not exempt,
it surely becomes them to use every exertion to <i>improve</i>
the art of <i>restoring animation</i>. May each
progressive step in this interesting path of science
tend to that great object! and may every laudable
attempt undertaken with that benevolent view enable
us with more certainty to preserve life and to diminish
the sum of human infelicity!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span></p>

<p>It is regrettable that medical practitioners, neither in
this nor in any of the Continental states, except,
possibly, a few in Germany, have been trained to
distinguish apparent from real death; and when a
case of death-trance occurs, they certify to actual
death, and the unfortunate person is interred in a
strong coffin, which effectually conceals the tragedy
following resuscitation. Moreover, the ordinary practitioner,
both in England and the United States, considers
himself exonerated from blame when he thus follows
the traditions and practice of the heads of his profession.
Personally, he has neither the time, opportunity, or
inclination to study the abnormal phenomena of trance,
catalepsy, or hypnotisation, and thus the evil of live
sepulture is perpetuated from generation to generation.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p class="psh p4">SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS.</p>

<p>(1) An examination of both the historical and modern
cases of trance, catalepsy, and other death-counterfeits
shows that nothing is more uncertain than the so-called
signs of death, and that in all countries and in all ages
many persons supposed by their attendant physicians
and relations to be dead have revived, while the cases
are as numerous and the danger as great at the present
day as at any previous period.</p>

<p>(2) That the risk of premature burial is especially
serious in France, in Spain and Portugal, in the west of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
Ireland, in both European and Asiatic Turkey, and in
India; also amongst the Jews, where both the Jewish
law and ancient customs enjoin burial within a few hours
of death, and for similar reasons in all Oriental countries;
and in the Southern States of North America.</p>

<p>(3) That the various signs which are supposed to
indicate death, such as the cessation of respiration and
of cardiac action, a pale, waxy and death-like appearance,
the stiffening of the limbs, or <i>rigor mortis</i>, insensibility
to cutaneous excitation, the departure of heat from the
body, are singly and collectively illusory; the only safe
and infallible test of dissolution being the manifestation
of putrefaction in the abdomen.</p>

<p>(4) That medical death-certificates have been shown
by various witnesses before the Select Parliamentary
Committee of Inquiry of 1893-94 to be often misleading
as to the cause of death, and inconclusive as to the fact
of death. Any compulsory extension of the death-certification
system in the present imperfect state of medical
knowledge would only partially meet the necessities of
the case, and might have the effect of crystallising a
defective system into perfunctory routine. A certain
safeguard would, however, be provided if the law made
it binding on medical practitioners to set forth on the
death-certificate a precise statement of indications showing
that dissolution has actually occurred.</p>

<p>(5) That the only safe and effective method of reform
is the establishment of appropriately designed waiting
mortuaries, such as are provided at Munich, Weimar,
Stuttgart, and other German cities, with qualified attendants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
and appliances for resuscitation, and where doubtful
cases of death (and all are doubtful in which decomposition
has not clearly manifested itself) can be deposited
until the fact of death is unequivocally established.</p>

<p>(6) That premature burial in civilised countries is
mainly possible owing to the fact that instruction in the
phenomena of trance, catalepsy, syncope, and other forms
of suspended animation is not systematic in the medical
schools in any country, and the means of prevention are
therefore practically unknown. This omission should be
immediately remedied by the inclusion of the subject
at the appropriate place in the medical curriculum, and
in the examination for degrees.</p>

<p>(7) That, inasmuch as a radical change in the methods
of treating the dead or supposed dead is extremely
urgent, and legislation with an overworked Parliament
in England and apathetic State Legislatures in America
will probably be delayed, the authors recommend, as a
preliminary measure of protection, the formation of
associations for the prevention of premature burial
amongst their members, as in some cities in France,
Austria, and the United States, or the alternative plan
of engrafting such an obligation of prevention upon
existing associations, clubs, and insurance companies
established for other purposes.</p>

<p class="p2">If the foregoing conclusions are established, the need
for immediate action is urgent and imperative, and the
prompt intervention of Parliament should be at once
invoked. May we hope for the cordial co-operation
of all classes and of all sections on a question in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
which the whole community have a deep and vital
interest, and on which procrastination will certainly be
fatal to some of its members. It is not an academic
question, but one of the gravest practical character, the
earnest consideration and treatment of which cannot be
neglected with impunity.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">From</span> the time of Kornmann, Terilli, and Zacchia (see “Bibliography,”
seventeenth century), certain notable instances, from old authors, of
restoration from apparent death have been cited, with a good deal of
uniformity, in essays or theses on this subject. One of the most convenient
(to English readers) of these compilations is to be found in an
anonymous essay, “The Uncertainty of the Signs of Death,” Dublin,
1748 (printed by George Faulkner), from which the following extracts are
taken <i>verbatim</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p>Plutarch informs us that a certain person fell from an eminence, but
did not show the least appearance of any wound, for, three days after, he
suddenly resumed his strength, and returned to life as his friends were
conveying him to the grave.</p>

<p>Asclepiades, a celebrated physician, on his return from his country seat,
met a large company conveying a corpse to the grave. A principle of
curiosity induced him to ask the name of the deceased person, but grief
and sorrow reigned so universally that no one returned him answer; upon
which, approaching the corpse, he found the whole of it rubbed over with
perfumes, and the mouth moistened with precious balm, according to the
custom of the Greeks; then carefully feeling every part, and discovering
latent signs of life, he forthwith affirmed that the person was not dead, and
the person was saved.&mdash;<i>Celsus ii., 6, “De re Medica.”</i></p>

<p>In the tenth book of Plato’s Republic is related the story of one
Er, an Armenian, who was slain in battle. Ten days after, when
the surviving soldiers came with a view to inter the dead, they found all
the bodies corrupted except his; for which reason they conveyed him to
his own house in order to inter him in the usual manner. But two days
after, to the great surprise of all present, he returned to life when laid on
the funeral pile. Quenstedt remarks upon this case, which he took from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
Kornmann’s treatise “De Miraculis Mortuorum,” “That the soul sometimes
remains in the body when the senses are so fettered, and, as it were, locked
up, that it is hard to determine whether a person is dead or alive.” Pliny
in his “Natural History,” book vii., chap. 52, which treats of <i>those who
have returned to life when they were about to be laid in the grave</i>, tells us
that Acilius Aviola, a man of so considerable distinction that he had formerly
been honoured with the consulship, returned to life when he was
upon the funeral pile; but, as he could not be rescued from the violence of
the flames, he was burnt alive. The like misfortune also happened to
Lucius Lamia, who had been praetor. These two shocking accidents are
also related by Valerius Maximus. Celius Tubero had a happier fate than
his two fellow-citizens, since, according to Pliny, he discovered the signs of
life before it was too late. His state, however, was far from eligible, since,
being laid on the funeral pile, he stood a fair chance of being exposed to
the like misfortune. Pliny, from the testimony of Varro, adds that when
a distribution of land was making at Capua, a certain man, when carried a
considerable way from his own house in order to be interred, returned
home on foot. The like surprising accident also happened at Aquinum.
The last instance of this nature related by the author occurred at Rome,
and Pliny must, no doubt, have been intimately acquainted with all its
most minute circumstances, since the person was one Cerfidius, the husband
of his mother’s sister, who returned to life after an agreement had been
made for his funeral with the undertaker, who was probably much disappointed
when he found him alive and in good health.</p>

<p>These examples drawn from Roman history greatly contribute to
establish the uncertainty of the signs of death, and ought to render us
very cautious with respect to interments.</p>

<p>Greece and Italy are not the only theatres in which such tragical events
have been acted, since other countries of Europe also furnish us with
instances of a like nature. Thus, Maximilian Misson, in his “Voyage
Through Italy,” tome i, letter 5, tells us&mdash;</p>

<p>“That the number of persons who have been interred as dead, when they
were really alive, is very great in comparison with those who have been
happily rescued from their graves; for, in the town of Cologne, Archbishop
Geron&mdash;according to Albertus Krantzïus&mdash;was interred alive, and died for
want of a seasonable releasement.”</p>

<p>It is also certain that in the same town the like misfortune happened to
Johannes Duns Scotus, who in his grave tore his hands and wounded his
head. Misson also relates the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Some years ago the wife of one, Mr. Mervache, a goldsmith of Poictiers,
being buried with some rings on her fingers, as she had desired when dying, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
poor man of the neighbourhood, being apprised of that circumstance, next
night opened the grave in order to make himself master of the rings, but as
he could not pull them off without some violence, he in the attempt waked
the woman, who spoke distinctly, and complained of the injury done her.
Upon this, the robber made his escape. The woman, now roused from an
apoplectic fit, rose from her coffin, returned to her own house, and in a few
days recovered a perfect state of health.”</p>

<p>What induced Misson to relate these histories was a certain piece of
painting preserved in the Church of the Holy Apostles at Cologne, in order
to keep up the memory of a certain accident, which that traveller relates
in the following manner:&mdash;</p>

<p>“In the year 1571, the wife of one of the magistrates of Cologne
being interred with a valuable ring on one of her fingers, the grave-digger
next night opened the grave in order to take it off, but we may
readily suppose that he was in no small consternation when the supposed
dead body squeezed his hand, and laid fast hold of him, in order
to get out of her coffin. The thief, however, disengaging himself,
made his escape with all expedition; and the lady, disentangling herself
in the best manner she could, went home and knocked at her own door,
where, after shivering in her shroud, after some delay she was admitted by
the terror-stricken servants; and, being warmed and treated in a proper
manner, completely recovered.”</p>

<p>Simon Goubart, in his admirable and memorable histories, printed at
Geneva in 1628, relates the following accident:&mdash;“A lady, whose name
was Reichmuth Adoloh, was supposed to fall a victim to a pestilence, which
raged with such impetuous fury as to cut off most of the inhabitants of
Cologne. Soon after, however, she not only recovered her health, but
also brought into the world three sons, who, in process of time, were
advanced to livings in the Church.”</p>

<p>“The town of Dijon, in Burgundy, was, in the year 1558, afflicted with
a violent plague, which cut off the inhabitants so fast that there was not
time for each dead person to have a separate grave; for which reason
large pits were made and filled with as many bodies as they could contain.
In this deplorable conjuncture, Mrs. Nicole Tentillet shared the common
fate, and after labouring under the disorder for some days, fell into a
syncope so profound that she was taken for dead, and accordingly buried
in a pit with the other dead bodies. The next morning after her interment
she returned to life, and made the strongest efforts to get out, but was
held down by the weight of the bodies with which she was covered. She
remained in this wretched condition for four days, when the grave-diggers
took her out and carried her to her own house, where she recovered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
perfectly.” Following this case, that of a labouring man of Courçelles,
near Neuchâtel, is narrated. He fell into so profound syncope that he
was taken for dead; but the persons who were putting him into his grave
without a coffin, perceived some motion in his shoulders, for which reason
they carried him to his own home, where he perfectly recovered. This
accident laid the foundation for his being called the ghost of Courçelles.</p>

<p>“A lawyer of Vesoul, a town of Franche-Comté, near Besançon, so
carefully concealed a lethargy, to which he was subject, that nobody knew
anything of his disorder, though the paroxysms returned very frequently.
The motive which principally induced him to this secrecy was the dread
of losing a lady to whom he was just about to be married. Being afraid,
however, lest some paroxysm should prove fatal to him, he communicated
his case to the Sheriff of the town, who, by virtue of his office, was obliged
to take care of him if such a misfortune should happen. The marriage was
concluded, and the lawyer for a considerable time enjoyed a perfect state
of health, but at last was seized with so violent a paroxysm of the disease
that his lady, to whom he had not revealed the secret, not doubting his
death, ordered him to be put in his coffin. The Sheriff, though absent
when the paroxysm seized him, luckily returned in time to preserve him;
for he ordered the interment to be delayed, and the lawyer, returning to
life, survived the accident sixteen years.”</p>

<p>Another case is that of a certain person who was conveyed to the
church in order to be interred, but one of his friends sprinkling a large
quantity of holy water on his face, which was covered, he not only returned
to life, but also resumed a perfect state of health.</p>

<p>This writer subjoins other histories of persons who, being interred alive,
have expired in their graves and tombs, as has afterwards been discovered
by various marks made, not only in their sepulchres, but also in their own
bodies. He in a particular manner mentions a young lady of Auxbourg,
who, falling into a syncope, in consequence of a suffocation of the matrix,
was buried in a deep vault, without being covered with earth, because her
friends thought it sufficient to have the vault carefully shut up. Some
years after, however, one of the family happened to die; the vault was
opened, and the body of the young lady found on the stairs at its entry,
without any fingers on the right hand.</p>

<p>It is recorded in “Tr. de Aere et Alim. defect.,” cap. vii., that a certain
woman was hanged, and in all appearances was dead, who was nevertheless
restored to life by a physician accidentally coming in and ordering a
plentiful administration of sal ammoniac.</p>

<p>Another case of hanging is the story of Anne Green, executed at
Oxford, December 14, 1650. She was hanged by the neck for half an hour,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
some of her friends thumping her on the breast, others hanging with all
their weight upon her legs, and then pulling her down again with a sudden
jerk, thereby the sooner to despatch her out of her pain. After she was in
her coffin, being observed to breathe, a lusty fellow stamped with all his
force on her breast and stomach to put her out of pain. But by the
assistance of Dr. Petty, Dr. Willis, Dr. Bathurst, and Dr. Clark, she was
again brought to life.</p>

<p>Kornmann, in his treatise “De Miraculis Mortuorum,” relates the following
history:&mdash;“Saint Augustine, from Saint Cirille, informs us that a Cardinal
of the name of Andrew having died in Rome in the presence of several
bystanders, was next day conveyed to the church, where the Pope and a
body of the clergy attended service in order to do honour to his memory.
But to their great surprise, after some groans, he recovered his life and
senses. This event was at the time looked upon as a miracle, and ascribed
to Saint Jerome to whom the Cardinal was greatly attached.”</p>

<p>The following account seems more to resemble a miracle, though we do
not find that it was looked upon as such:&mdash;“Gocellinus, a young man, and
nephew to one of the Archbishops of Cologne, falling into the Rhine,
was not found for fifteen days after, but was discovered to be alive as he
lay before the shrine of Saint Guibert.”</p>

<p>Persons curious or incredulous upon the dangers of precipitate burials
may, for their satisfaction, have recourse to the medical observations of
Forestus; those of Amatus Lusitanus; the chirurgical observations of
William Fabri; the treatise of Levinus Lemnius on the secret miracles of
Nature; the observations of Schenkins; the medico-legal questions of Paul
Zacchias; Albertinus Bottonus’s treatise of the Disorders of Women;
Terilli’s treatise on the Causes of Sudden Death; Lancisi’s treatise Concerning
Deaths, and Kornmann’s treatise on the Miracles of the Dead.
These authors furnish us with a great variety of the most palpable and
flagrant instances of the uncertainty of the signs of death. As examples
of the possibility of even great anatomists being imposed upon by these
fallacious signs, the two following accidents are given:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Andreas Vesalius, successively first physician to Charles the Fifth and
his son Philip the Second of Spain, being persuaded that a certain
Spanish gentleman, whom he had under management, was dead, asked
liberty of his friends to lay open his body. His request being granted, he
no sooner plunged his dissecting-knife in the body than he observed signs
of life in it, since, upon opening the breast, he saw the heart palpitating.
The friends of the deceased, horrified by the accident, pursued Vesalius as a
murderer; and the judges inclined that he should suffer as such. By the
entreaties of the King of Spain, he was rescued from the threatening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
danger, on condition that he would expiate his crime by undertaking a
voyage to the Holy Land.”</p>

<p>The account of the accident that befell the other anatomist is taken from
Terilli, and runs as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>“A lady of distinction in Spain, being seized with an hysteric suffocation
so violent that she was thought irretrievably dead, her friends
employed a celebrated anatomist to lay open her body to discover the
cause of her death. Upon the second stroke of the knife she was
roused from her disorder, and discovered evident signs of life by her
lamentable shrieks extorted by the fatal instrument. This melancholy
spectacle struck the bystanders with so much consternation and horror
that the anatomist, now no less condemned and abhorred than before
applauded and extolled, was forthwith obliged to quit not only the town
but also the province in which the guiltless tragedy was acted. But though
he quitted the now disagreeable scene of the accident, a groundless remorse
preyed upon his soul, till at last a fatal melancholy put an end to his
life.”</p>

<p>Physicians of the earlier ages knew that there were disorders which so
locked up or destroyed the external senses that the patients labouring under
them appeared to be dead. According to Mr. Le Clerc, in his “History
of Medicine,” Diogenes Laertius informs us “that Empedocles was particularly
admired for curing a woman supposed to be dead, though that
philosopher frankly acknowledged that her disorder was only a suffocation
of the matrix, and affirmed that the patient might live in that state (the
absence of respiration) for thirty days.”</p>

<p>Mr. Le Clerc, in the work already quoted, tells us that “Heraclides of
Pontus wrote a book concerning the causes of diseases, in which he
affirmed that a patient is without respiration in certain disorders for
thirty days, and that they appeared dead in every respect, except corruption
of the body.”</p>

<p>To these authorities we may add that of Pliny, who, after mentioning
the lamentable fate of Aviola and Lamia, affirms&mdash;“That such is the
condition of humanity, and so uncertain the judgment men are capable
of forming of things, that even death itself is not to be trusted to.”</p>

<p>Colerus, in “Oeconom.” part vi., lib. xviii., cap. 113, observes, “That a
person as yet not really dead may, for a long time, remain apparently in
that state without discovering the least signs of life; and this has happened
in the times of the Plague, when a great many persons interred have
returned to life in their graves.” Authors also inform us that the like
accident frequently befalls women seized with a suffocation of the matrix
(hysteria).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span></p>

<p>Forestus, in “Obs. Med.,” 1. xvii., obs. 9, informs us&mdash;“That drowned
persons have returned to life after remaining forty-eight hours in the water;
and sometimes women, buried during a paroxysm of the hysteric passion,
have returned to life in their graves; for which reason it is forbidden in
some countries to bury the dead sooner than seventy-two hours after
death.” This precaution of delaying the interment of persons thought
to be dead is of a very ancient date, since Dilberus, in “Disput. Philol.,”
tome i., observes that Plato ordered the bodies of the dead to be kept till
the third day, <i>in order to be satisfied of the reality of death</i>.</p>

<p>The burial customs of the ancients often included steps that were taken
as a precaution against mistaking the living for the dead. Indeed the fear
of such an accident seems to have always been entertained as a thing liable
to occur in every case of seeming death. The embalming process employed
by the Egyptians was a surgical test of the kind. The abdomen was first
opened in order to remove the intestines, and some startling experiences
must have been had in consequence of the incisions required for this
operation, because it was customary for the friends and relatives of the
deceased to throw stones at the persons employed in embalming as soon
as the work was over, owing to the horror with which they were struck
upon witnessing what must have been at times a cruel proceeding.</p>

<p>The funeral ceremonies used in the Caribbee Islands are, in a great
measure, conformable to reason. They wash the body, wrap it up in a
cloth, and then begin a series of lamentations and discourses calculated to
recall the deceased to life, by naming all the pleasures and privileges he
has enjoyed in the world, saying over and over again, “How comes it,
then, that you have died?” When the lamentations are over, they place
the body on a small seat, in a grave about four or five feet deep, and for
ten days present aliments to it, entreating it to eat. Then, convinced that
it would neither eat nor return to life, they, for its obstinacy, throw the
victuals on its head, and cover up the grave. It is evident from the
practices of this people that they wait so long before they cover the body
with earth, because they have had instances of persons recalled to life by
these measures.</p>

<p>Lamentations of a similar kind were employed by the Jews and
Romans, as well as by the ancient Prussians and the inhabitants of Servia,
founded doubtless upon similar experiences.</p>

<p>The Thracians, according to Herodotus, kept their dead for only three
days, at the end of which time they offered up sacrifices of all kinds, and,
after bidding their last adieu to the deceased, either burned or interred
their bodies.</p>

<p>According to Quenstedt, the ancient Russians laid the body of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
dead person naked on a table, and washed it for an hour with warm water.
Then they put it into a bier, which was set in the most public room in the
house. On the third day they conveyed it to the place of interment,
where the bier, being opened, the women embraced the body with great
lamentations. Then the singers spent an hour in shouting and making
a noise in order to recall it to life; after which it was let down into the
grave and covered with earth. So that this people used the test of warm
water, that of cries, and a reasonable delay, before they proceeded to the
interment.</p>

<p>In the laws and history of the Jews, there is but one regulation with
respect to interment (in the twenty-first chapter of Deuteronomy), where
the Jewish legislator orders persons hanged to be buried the same day.
From this, one is led to infer that the funeral ceremonies, as handed down
from Adam, were otherwise perfect and unexceptionable. The bier used
by the Jews, on which the body was laid, was not shut at the top, as our
coffins are, as is obvious from the resurrection of the Widow of Nain’s son,
recorded in the seventh chapter of Luke, where these words occur:&mdash;“And
he came and touched the bier, and they that bare him stood still.
And he said, Young man, I say unto thee, Arise; and he that was dead sat
up and began to speak.”</p>

<p>Gierus and Calmet inform us that the body, before its interment, lay
for some days in the porch or dining-room of the house. According to
Maretus, it was probably during this time that great lamentations were
made, in which the name of the deceased was intermixed with mournful
cries and groans.</p>

<p>Mr. Boyer, member of the Faculty at Paris, observes that such lamentations
are still used by the Eastern Jews, and even by the Greeks who
embrace the articles of the Greek Church. These people hire women to
weep and dance by turns round the body of the dead person, whom they
interrogate with respect to the reasons they had for dying.</p>

<p>Lanzoni, a physician of Ferrara, informs us that “when any person
among the Romans died, his nearest relatives closed his mouth and eyes,
and when they saw him ready to expire, they caught his last words and
sighs. Then calling him aloud three times by his name, they bade him an
eternal adieu.” This ceremony of calling the name of the dying person was
called Conclamation, a custom that dates prior to the foundation of Rome,
and was only abolished with paganism.</p>

<p>Propertius acquaints us with the effect they expected from the first
Conclamation&mdash;since there were several of them. He introduces Cynthia
as saying, “Nobody called me by my name at the time my eyes were closing,
and I should have enjoyed an additional day if you had recalled me to life.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span></p>

<p>Conclamations were made also by trumpets and horns, blown upon the
head, into the ears, and upon neck and chest, so as to penetrate all the
cavities of the body, into which, as the ancients imagined, the soul might
possibly make her retreat.</p>

<p>Quenstedt and Casper Barthius, in “Advers.,” lib. xxxvii., ch. 17, tell us
that it was customary among the ancients to wash the bodies of their dead
in warm water before they burned them, “that the heat of the water might
rouse the languid principle of life which might possibly be left in the body.”</p>

<p>By warm water we are to understand boiling water, as is obvious from
the copious steam arising from the vessel represented in pieces of statuary
in such instances: as also from the Sixth Book of Virgil’s “Æneid”&mdash;“Some
of the companions of Æneas, with boiling water taken from brazen
vessels, wash the dead body, and then anoint it.”</p>

<p>The Romans, as Lanzoni informs us, kept the bodies of the dead seven
days before they interred them; and Servius, in his commentary on Virgil,
tells us “that on the eighth day they burned the body, and on the ninth
put its ashes in the grave.” Polydorus and Alexander ab Alexandro are
also of opinion that the Romans kept the dead seven days; and Gierus
affirms that they sometimes did not bury them till the ninth; but it is
easy to believe that they deviated from the most universal custom when
evident and incontestable marks of death rendered it safe to inter before
the usual time. Alexander ab Alexandro also observes that it was customary
among the Greeks to keep the bodies of their dead seven days before
they put them on the funeral pile.</p>

<p>It would have, perhaps, been sufficient to have kept the bodies of the
dead seven days, or nine, or till putrefaction evinced the certainty of death;
but the Romans carried their circumspection farther, since, to use the words
of Quenstedt, “Those who were employed in watching the dead now and
then began their conclamations, and all at once called the dead person aloud
by his name, because, as Celsus informs us, the principle of life is often
thought to have left the body when it still remains in it; for which reason
conclamations were made, in order, if possible, to rouse it and excite it.”</p>

<p>If our senses are so imperfect that the signs of life may escape them; if
the languid state of the sensitive powers, or the origin of the nerves, is such
that the most painful chirurgical operations are sometimes insufficient to
put the spirits in motion; if the duration of a perfect insensibility for a
considerable number of days is a precarious and uncertain mark of death;
and if situations, apparently the most inconsistent with life, for a considerable
time amount only to strong presumptions that life is destroyed, we ought,
with Mr. Winslow and a great many other celebrated authors, to conclude
that a beginning of putrefaction is the only certain sign of death.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Winslow evidently proves that the most cruel chirurgical operations
are sometimes insufficient to ascertain death. From these observations we
can but conclude&mdash;(1) That it is to no purpose to use the most cruel
chirurgical operations; and (2) that it is necessary to abstain from such as
may prove mortal to the patient. Mr. Winslow is indeed so far from
recommending operations of the last mentioned kind, that he calls it rash
to plunge a long needle under the nail of an apoplectic patient’s toe.</p>

<p>But if Mr. Winslow thinks it rash to make a simple puncture in a
nervous part, we ought, surely, not to entertain a favourable notion of the
large and enormous incisions made in dissections. Those, indeed, who are
dissected run no risk of being interred alive. The operation is an infallible
means to secure them from so terrible a fate. This is one advantage
which persons dissected have over those who are without any further
ceremony shut up in their coffins.</p>

<hr class="d1" />

<p>In the appendix to the second edition of Dr. Curry’s “Observations on
Apparent Death” several instances of a similar kind are added, and
amongst others the case of William Earl of Pembroke, who died April 30,
1630. When the body was opened in order to be embalmed, he was
observed, immediately after the incision was made, to lift up his hand. This
is capped by the incident of Vesalius already given.</p>

<p>“A correspondent of the late Dr. Hawes assures us that there was then
living in Hertfordshire a lady of an ancient and honourable family whose
mother was brought to life after interment by the attempt of a thief to steal
a valuable ring from her finger. (See Reports of the Royal Humane
Society for 1787-88-89, p. 77.) Whether it was the same or not I cannot
say, but Lady Dryden, who resided in the southern part of Northamptonshire,
in consequence of some such event having occurred in her family
expressly directed in her will that her body should have the throat cut
across previous to interment; and to secure this bequeathed fifty pounds to
an eminent physician, who actually performed it.”&mdash;<i>Ibid., p. 106.</i></p>

<p>Dr. Elliotson refers to a case of a female who was pronounced to be
dead. Her pulse could not be felt, and she was put into a coffin; and, as
the coffin lid was being closed they observed a sweat break out, and thus
saw that she was alive. She recovered completely, and then stated that
she had been unable to give any signs of life whatever; that she was conscious
of all that was going on around her; that she heard everything;
and that when she found the coffin lid about to be put on,the agony was
dreadful beyond all description, so that it produced the sweat seen by the
attendants.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span></p>

<p class="psh">DEATH-TRANCE.</p>

<p>In two cases related by the late Mr. Braid, of Manchester, “the patients
remained in the horrible condition of hearing various remarks about
their death and interment. All this they heard distinctly without having
the power of giving any indication that they were alive, until some
accidental abrupt impression aroused them from their lethargy, and
rescued them from their perilous situation. On one of these occasions,
what most intensely affected the feelings of the entranced subject, as she
afterwards communicated to my informant, was hearing a little sister, who
came into the room, where she was laid out for dead, exulting in the
prospect, in consequence of her death, of getting possession of a necklace
of the deceased.” In another instance, the patient remained in a cataleptic
condition for fourteen days. During this period, the visible signs of
vitality were a slight degree of animal heat and appearance of moisture
when a mirror was held close to her face. But although she had no
voluntary power to give indication by word or gesture, nevertheless she heard
and understood all that was said and proposed to be done, and suffered the
most exquisite torture from various tests applied to her.... There
is hardly a more interesting chapter in the records of medical literature
than the history of well-authenticated cases of profound lethargy or death-trance.
Most of the reported cases in which persons in a state of trance
are stated to have been consigned to the horrors of a living burial may
possibly be apocryphal. Still, on the other hand, there are unquestionably
too many well-substantiated instances of the actual occurrence of this
calamity, the horrors of which no effort of the imagination can exaggerate,
and for the prevention of which no pains can be excessive and no
precaution superfluous.</p>

<p>The following is taken from “Memorials of the Family of Scott, of
Scott’s Hall, in the County of Kent, with an Appendix of Illustrative
Documents,” by James Benat Scott, F. S. A., London, 1876, page
225:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Robert Scott, Esq., tenth (but sixth surviving) son of Sir Thomas
Scott, of Scot’s-Hall, Knight, married Priscilla, one of the daughters of
Sir Thomas Honywood, of Elmsmere, Knight, by whom he had nine
children. Remarkable accidents happened to the said Robert Scott
and Priscilla, his wife, before their marriage, at their marriage, and after
their marriage, before they had children. At their marriage, which was in
or about the year 1610, the said Robert Scott having forgot his wedding
ring when they were to be married, the said Priscilla was married with a
ring with death’s head upon it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span></p>

<p>“Within a short time after they were married, the said Robert Scott,
and Priscilla, his wife, sojourning with Sir Edward at Austenhanger, the
said Robert Scott, about Bartholomewtide, fell sick of a desperate malignant
fever, and was given over for dead by all, insomuch as that he was
laid forth, the pillows pulled from under him, the curtains drawn, and the
chamber windows set open, and ministers spoke to to preach the funeral
service, and a book called for his funeral that was to have been kept at
Scott’s Hall, where Sir John Scott the eldest brother then lived. At night
he was watched with by his own servant, named Robins, and another
servant in the house, and about midnight they, sitting together by the fire
in the chamber, the said Robins said to the other, ‘Methinks my master
should not be dead, I will go and try,’ and presently starting up went to
the bedside where his master laid, and hallooed in his ear, and laid a feather
to his nostrils, and perceived that he breathed, upon which he called them
up in the house, and they warmed clothes and rubbed him, and brought
him to life again. He lived afterwards to be upwards of seventy-two years
of age, and to have nine children.</p>

<p>“Another remarkable passage was that his wife, Priscilla, being then very
sick also, they told her that he was dead. She answered that she did not
believe that God would part them so soon. The said Priscilla, when
born, was laid for dead, no one minding her, but all the women went to
help her mother, who was then like to die after her delivery; but at last an
old woman, taking the child in her arms, carried it downstairs, and using
means, brought her to life. The other women, missing the child, and
hearing the old woman had carried her down to get life in her, laughed at
her, as thinking it impossible to bring the child to life; but in a little time
she brought it into the chamber, to the amazement of them all, and said
she might live to be an old woman; and so she did to the age of fifty-two,
and had nine children.”</p>

<p>The following cases are from Mrs. Crowe’s “Night Side of Nature,”
pp. 133-136:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Dr. Burns mentions a girl at Canton, who lay in a trance, hearing
every word that was said around her, but utterly unable to move a finger.
She tried to cry out, but could not, and supposed that she was really dead.
The horror of finding that she was about to be buried at length caused a
perspiration to appear on her skin, and she finally revived. She described
that she felt that her soul had no power to act upon her body, and that it
seemed to be <i>in her body and out of it at the same time</i>.”</p>

<p>“Lady Fanshawe related the case of her mother who being sick of a
fever, her friends and servants thought her deceased, and she lay in that
state for two days and a night; but Mr. Winslow, coming to comfort my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
father, went into my mother’s room, and looking earnestly into her face,
said, ‘She was so handsome, and looked so lovely, that he could not think
her dead,’ and, suddenly taking a lancet out of his pocket, he cut the sole
of her foot, which bled: upon this he immediately caused her to be removed
to the bed again, and she opened her eyes, after rubbing and other
restorative means, and came to life.”</p>

<p>“On the 10th of January, 1717, Mr. John Gardner, a minister at Elgin,
fell into a trance, and being to all appearances dead, he was put into a
coffin and on the second day was carried to the grave. But fortunately a
noise being heard, the coffin was opened, and he was found alive and taken
home again, where, according to the record, ‘he related many strange and
amazing things which he had seen in the other world.’”</p>

<p>Under the head of “Suspended Animation: Cases of Recovery, etc.,”
the Report of the Royal Humane Society for 1816-17, pp. 48-50, copies
the following:&mdash;“A young lady, an attendant on the Princess of&mdash;&mdash;,
after having been confined to her bed for a great length of time with a
violent disorder, was at last to all appearances deprived of life. Her lips
were quite pale, her face resembled the countenance of a dead person, and
her body became cold.</p>

<p>“She was removed from the room in which she died, was laid in a
coffin, and the day of her funeral was fixed on. The day arrived, and,
according to the custom of the country, funeral songs and hymns were sung
before the door. Just as they were about to nail on the lid of the coffin, a
slight perspiration was observed to appear on the surface of her body. It
grew greater every moment, and at last a kind of convulsive motion was
observed in the hands and feet of the corpse. A few moments after,
during which time fresh signs of returning life appeared, she at once
opened her eyes, and uttered a pitiable shriek. Physicians were quickly
procured, and in the course of a few days she was considerably restored,
and is probably alive at this day.”</p>

<p>The description which she herself gave of her situation is extremely
remarkable, and forms a curious and authentic addition to psychology:&mdash;</p>

<p>“She said it seemed to her, as if in a dream, that she was really dead;
yet she was perfectly conscious of all that happened around her in this
dreadful state. She distinctly heard her friends speaking, and lamenting
her death at the side of her coffin. She felt them pull on the dead-clothes
and lay her in it. This feeling produced a mental anxiety which was
indescribable. She tried to cry, but her soul was without power and could
not act on her body. She had the contradictory feeling as if she were in
her body, and yet not in it, at one and the same time. It was equally
impossible for her to stretch out her arms, or to open her eyes, or to cry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
although she continued to do so. The internal anguish of her mind was,
however, at its utmost height when the funeral hymns began to be sung,
and when the lid of the coffin was about to be nailed on. The thought
that she was to be buried alive was the first one which gave activity to her
soul, and caused it to operate on her corporeal frame.”</p>

by Sir Alexander Crichton in the introduction to his essay on “Mental
Derangement.” [2 vols., Lond., 1798.]</p>

<p>“One of the most frightful cases extant is that of Dr. Walker, of Dublin,
who had so strong a presentiment on this subject, that he had actually
written a treatise against the Irish custom of hasty burial. He, himself,
subsequently died, as was believed, of a fever. His decease took place in
the night, and on the following day he was interred. At this time, Mrs.
Bellamy, the once-celebrated actress, was in Ireland; and as she had
promised him, in the course of conversation, that she would take care he
should not be laid in the earth till unequivocal signs of dissolution had
appeared, she no sooner heard of what had happened than she took
measures to have the grave reopened; but it was, unfortunately, too late.
Dr. Walker had evidently revived, and had turned upon his side; but life
was quite extinct.”</p>

<p>Mr. Horace Welby, in a chapter on “Premature Interment,” says that
“the Rev. Owen Manning, the historian of Surrey, during his residence
at Cambridge University, caught small-pox, and was reduced by the
disorder to a state of insensibility and apparent death. The body was
laid out and preparations were made for the funeral, when Mr. Manning’s
father, going into the chamber to take a last look at his son, raised the
imagined corpse from its recumbent position, saying, ‘I will give my
poor boy another chance,’ upon which signs of vitality were apparent.
He was therefore removed by his friend and fellow-student, Dr. Heberden,
and ultimately restored to health.”&mdash;<i>The Mysteries of Life and Death,

<p>A most conspicuous and interesting monument in St. Giles’s Church,
Cripplegate, London (where Cromwell was married and John Milton
buried), is associated with a remarkable case of trance or catalepsy.
In the chancel is a striking sculptured figure in memory of Constance
Whitney, a lady of remarkable gifts, whose rare excellences are fully
described in the tablet. She is represented as rising from her coffin.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
Welby, at p. 116, relates the story that she had been buried while in a state
of suspended animation, but was restored to life through the cupidity of the
sexton, which induced him to disinter the body to obtain possession of a
valuable ring left upon her finger, which he concluded could be of no use to
the wearer. A study of the facts of premature burial shows that the rifling
of tombs and coffins to obtain valuables has in other instances revealed
similar tragic occurrences.</p>

<p>The often-cited case of Mrs. Goodman, one of those recalled to life by
the sexton’s attempt to remove a ring from the finger, is thus related in the
“History of Bandon,” by George Bennett:&mdash;</p>

<p>Hannah, wife of Rev. Richard Goodman, vicar of Ballymodan, Bandon,
from 1692 to 1737, fell into ill-health, and apparently died. Two or three
days after her decease, the body was taken to Rosscarbery Cathedral, and
there laid in the family vault of the Goodmans. The attempt of the sexton
to recover a valuable diamond ring from the finger is said to have been
made at an early hour the next morning. Much violence was used, so that
the corpse moved, yawned, and sat up. The sexton having fled in terror,
leaving his lantern behind and the church door open, the lady in her
shroud made her way out of the vault and through the church to the
residence of her brother-in-law, the Rev. Thomas Goodman, which was
just outside the church-yard. Having been admitted after some delay
and consternation, she was put to bed, and fell asleep soon after, her
brother-in-law and his man-servant keeping watch over her until mid-day,
when she awoke refreshed. She is said to have shown herself in the village
in the afternoon, to have supped with the family in the evening, and to
have set out for home on horseback next morning. She is said to have
survived this episode for some years, and to have borne a son subsequent
to it, who died at an advanced age at Innishannon, a village near Bandon.</p>

<p>In Smith’s “History of Cork,” vol. ii., p. 428, the same incident is thus
mentioned:&mdash;“Mr. John Goodman, of Cork, died in January, 1747, aged
about four score; but what is remarkable of him, his mother was interred
while she lay in a trance, having been buried in a vault, etc....
This Mr. Goodman was born some time after.”</p>

<hr class="d1" />

<p>Mr. Peckard, Master of Magdalen College, Cambridge, in a work
entitled “Further Observations on the Doctrine of an Intermediate State,”
mentions that Mrs. Godfrey, Mistress of the Jewel Office, and sister of the
great Duke of Marlborough, is stated to have lain in a trance, apparently
dead, for seven days, and was declared by her medical attendants to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
been dead. Colonel Godfrey, her husband, would not allow her to be
interred, or the body to be treated in the manner of a corpse; and on the
eighth day she awoke, without any consciousness of her long insensibility.</p>

<p>The daughter of Henry Laurens, of South Carolina, the first President
of the American Congress during the Revolutionary War, died when young
of small-pox. At all events a medical certificate pronounced her dead, and
she was shrouded and coffined for interment. It was customary in those
days to confine the patient amidst red curtains with closed windows.
After the certificate of death had been duly made out, the curtains were
thrown back and the windows opened. The fresh air revived the patient,
who recovered and lived to a mature age. This circumstance occasioned on
her father so powerful a dread of living interment, that he directed by will
that his body should be burnt, and enjoined on his children the performance
of this wish as a sacred duty.</p>

<p>Bouchut in his “Signes de la Mort,” p. 58, relates that the physician
of Queen Isabella of Spain was treating a man during a dangerous illness,
and as he went to see his patient one morning he was informed by the
assistants that the man had died. He entered, and found the body, in the
habit of the Order of St. Francis, laid out upon a board. Nothing daunted,
he had him put back to bed in spite of the ridicule of those present, and
the patient soon revived and fully recovered.</p>

<p>The following cases are from Köppen (see Bibliography, 1799):&mdash;</p>

<p>Vienna. 1791.&mdash;A castle guard (<i>portier</i>) was in a trance for several days.
His funeral was prepared, and he was placed in a coffin. All at once he
unexpectedly opened his eyes and called out, “Mother, where is the
coffee?”</p>

<p>Halle, 1753.&mdash;In the register of deaths, at St. Mary’s Church, is the following
entry:&mdash;“Shoemaker Casper Koch was buried, aged eighty-one years.
Thirty years ago he had died, to all appearances, and was put in a coffin,
when suddenly, when they were about to bury him, he recovered his
consciousness.”</p>

<p>Haag, Holland, 1785.&mdash;The son of a cook died, and while the coffin was
being carried to the grave-yard, he was heard to knock. On opening the
coffin he was found alive. He was taken home and was restored.</p>

<p>In the “Cyclopædia of Practical Medicine,” edited by John Forbes,
M.D., F.R.S., and others, 1847, vol. i., pp. 548-549, is the following:&mdash;“A
remarkable instance of resuscitation after apparent death occurred in
France, in the neighbourhood of Douai, in the year 1745, and is related by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
Rigaudeaux, (<i>Journal des Sçavans</i>, 1749,) to whom the case was confided.
He was summoned in the morning to attend a woman in labour, at a
distance of about a league. On his arrival, he was informed that she had
died in a convulsive fit two hours previously. The body was already
prepared for interment, and on examination he could discover no indications
of life. The os uteri was sufficiently dilated to enable him to turn the
child and deliver by the feet. The child appeared to be dead also; but, by
persevering in the means of resuscitation for three hours, they excited some
signs of vitality, which encouraged them to proceed, and their endeavours
were ultimately crowned with complete success. Rigaudeaux again carefully
examined the mother, and was confirmed in the belief of her death;
but he found that, although she had been in that state for seven hours, her
limbs retained their flexibility. Stimulants were applied in vain; he took
his leave, recommending that the interment should be deferred until the
flexibility was lost. At five p.m. a messenger came to inform him that
she had revived at half-past three. The mother and child were both alive
three years after.”</p>

<h2 class="p4"><a id="appb" name="appb">APPENDIX B.</a></h2>

<p class="pch">RESUSCITATION OF STILL-BORN AND OTHER INFANTS.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">The</span> danger of premature burial of still-born (apparently dead) infants is
clearly shown by the following quotation from Tidy’s “Legal Medicine,”
part ii., page 253, from tables given on the authority of the <i>British and
Foreign Medical Review</i>, No. ii., p. 235, based on eight millions of births.
“It would appear that from one in eighteen to one in twenty births are
still-born. Dr. Lever found that the proportion in his three thousand cases
was one in eighteen. So notorious is it that a large number of these deaths
could be averted, that some legislation is urgently needed, requiring that
still-borns, whose bodies weigh, say, not less than two pounds (the average
weight about the sixth and seventh months at which children are viable),
should not be buried without registration and a medical examination.”</p>

<p>Many instances can be found in current medical literature of still-born
infants that have been revived by artificial respiration. Such cases not
infrequently revive without any means being employed for their resuscitation;
but among the poor, who dispose of the new-born apparently dead
in a hasty manner, they might be buried alive through carelessness. The
use of mortuaries, where the seeming dead would be kept under observation
until decomposition appears, would of course prevent such disasters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span></p>

<p>Struve, in the Essay cited in the Bibliography (1802), says:&mdash;</p>

<p>“All still-born children should be considered as only apparently dead,
and the resuscitative process ought never to be neglected. Sometimes two
hours or more will elapse before reanimation can be effected. An
ingenious man-midwife, says Bruhier, was employed for several hours in
the revival of an apparently still-born child, and as his endeavours proved
unavailing, he considered the subject really dead. Being, however,
accidentally detained, he again turned his attention to the child, and by
continuing the resuscitative method for some time it was unexpectedly
restored to life” (p. 150).</p>

<p>The following is one of Struve’s most striking cases:&mdash;</p>

<p>A Mr. E.&mdash;&mdash; called in 18&mdash;&mdash; to obtain a certificate of death for a
still-born child of seven months’ gestation. Arriving at the house, the
doctor found the child laid upon a little straw and covered with a slight
black shawl; this was one p.m., and the child had been there since five a.m.
It was icy cold, and there was no heart sound nor respiration, but there
was a slight muscular twitching over the region of the heart. The child
was immersed in a hot bath and artificial respiration employed, but for
twenty minutes the case seemed hopeless; then the eyes opened and
after continued effort the respirations began, laborious and interrupted at
first, then normal by degrees. The child was saved, and became an
accomplished violinist.</p>

<p>The mortality and waste of infant life, particularly in large cities like
Paris, London, Berlin, Vienna, and New York, is admitted by all
investigators to be enormous. In France medical writers, in view of the
small percentage of births to population, are waking up to the realisation
that the State cannot afford the loss, and that, among other things, steps
should be taken to resuscitate the still-born, so that none should be buried
before unequivocal signs of death are manifested.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> The premature
abandonment of the still-born among the poorer classes in crowded cities is
only too probable. There are also cases recorded which show a corresponding
risk to infants who have survived their birth:&mdash;</p>

<p>The <i>British Medical Journal</i>, January 21, 1871, p. 71, gives the
following case, under the heading, “Alive in a Coffin”:&mdash;“Stories of this
kind are generally very apocryphal; but the following reaches us from an
authentic source. A child narrowly escaped being buried alive last week<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
in Manchester. The infant’s father had died, and was to be buried in
Ardwick Cemetery. The day before the burial the infant was taken ill,
and apparently died. A certificate of death was procured from a surgeon’s
assistant who had seen the child, and, to save expense, it was decided to
place it in the same coffin with the father. This was done, and the next
morning the bearers set off to the cemetery with their double burden; but
before reaching the grave-yard a cry was heard to issue from the coffin.
The lid being removed, the infant was discovered alive and kicking. It was
at once removed to a neighbour’s house, but died eight hours afterwards.</p>

<p>The <i>British Medical Journal</i>, 1885, ii., p. 841, gives the following case,
under the heading, “Death or Coma?”</p>

<p>“The close similarity which is occasionally seen to connect the appearance
of death with that of exhaustion following disease, was lately
illustrated in a somewhat striking manner. An infant seized with convulsions
was supposed to have died about three weeks ago at Stamford
Hill. After five days’ interval, preparations were being made for its
interment, when, at the grave’s mouth, a cry was heard to come from the
coffin. The lid was taken off, and the child was found to be alive; it was
taken home, and is recovering.”</p>

<p>The following is from Tidy’s “Legal Medicine,” pt. i., p. 29:&mdash;</p>

<p>“In a communication to the French Academy, Professor Fort mentions
a child (<i>ætat.</i> three) having been resuscitated by artificial respiration continued
for four hours, and not commenced until three and a half hours
after its apparent decease.</p>

<p>“Ogston records one case of a child alive for seven hours, and a second
case of a young woman alive for four hours, after they had been left as
dead.”</p>

<p>From the <i>Lancet</i>, April 22, 1882, p. 675:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="pc1">“PREMATURE INTERMENT.</p>

<p>“A daily contemporary states that at the gates of the Avignon cemetery
the parents of a child certified to have died of croup insisted on having
the coffin opened to take a last look. The child was found breathing, and
is expected to be saved.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">The following letter to the editor of the <i>Lancet</i>, March 31, 1866, p. 360,
illustrates the danger to which infants supposed to be dead are exposed,
under one of our traditional customs:&mdash;</p>

<div class="pbq">

<p class="pc1">“LAYING-OUT OF DEAD INFANTS.</p>

<p>“Sir,&mdash;In your journal of last Saturday, among the ‘Medical Annotations,’
you notice the inquiry into the circumstances under which an infant, being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
still living and moving, was ‘bandaged’ beneath the chin, and ‘laid-out’
at St. Pancras Workhouse. Allow me to state that in the <i>Lancet</i>, vol. ii.,
1850, a contribution from me ‘On the Danger of Tying-up the Lower Jaw
immediately after Supposed Death’ was published. An infant, aged two
months, was brought to me on a Friday with the lower jaw tied up by its
mother, who asked for a certificate of death; but on my removing the
bandage, the child began to show symptoms of vitality, and it lived until
the following Monday.</p>

<p>“Chester Terrace, Chester Square, March 26, 1866.”</p></div>

<p class="p1">It is recorded that Dr. Doddridge showed so little signs of life at his birth
that he was laid aside as dead, but one of the attendants observing some
signs of life, took the baby under her charge, and by her judicious treatment
perfectly restored it.</p>

<p>Mr. Highmore, Secretary of the London Lying-in Hospital, confirmed (by
a communication to the Royal Humane Society, April, 1816,) the statement
of Mrs. Catherine Widgen, the matron of that excellent establishment, that,
by a zealous perseverance in the means recommended by that Society, she
had been the happy instrument of restoring from a state of apparent death
in the space of <i>three years</i> no less than forty-five infants, who, but for her
humane attention and indefatigable exertions, must have been consigned to
the grave. Later on, Mrs. Widgen restored in one year twenty-seven
apparently dead-born children&mdash;a striking instance of the truth of the
remark of a celebrated writer (Osiander) that “the generality of infants,
considered as still-born, are only apparently so; if, therefore, persons would
persevere in their exertions to revive them, most of them might be
restored.”&mdash;<i>Report of the Royal Humane Society, 1816-17, pp. 52-54.</i></p>

<p>“For these exertions the General Court adjudged the Honorary
Medallion to Mrs. Widgen, and it was accordingly presented to her by
His Royal Highness the Duke of Kent.”&mdash;<i>Ibid., p. 52.</i></p>

<p>[The question naturally suggests itself in this place: If the matron of such
a noble institution as the above was able to save seventy-two apparently
dead children from the grave in four years, how many of these poor little
beings are consigned to the grave all over the world for lack of the “humane
attention and indefatigable exertions,” such as this skilful matron gave to
those that came under her intelligent care?]</p>

<p class="psh">“RECURRENCE OF SUSPENDED ANIMATION.</p>

<p>“A child, who had a cough for some time, was suddenly attacked with
difficulty of breathing, and <i>to all appearances died</i>. A medical gentleman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
immediately inflated the lungs, and by persisting in this for a considerable
time, recovered the child. A similar state of suspended animation took
place three or four times, and inflation was as often had recourse to with
the same success; but the attack, happening, unfortunately, to recur whilst
the medical gentleman in whose family the case happened was from home,
the proper measures were not taken, and the child was lost.”&mdash;<i>Ibid., p. 140.</i></p>

<p class="psh">“SHOCK FROM LIGHTNING.</p>

<p>“A boy was struck down by a flash of lightning near Hoxton (in the
suburbs of London), and lay exposed to the rain at least an hour, until his
companions carried him home on some boards, apparently dead&mdash;the body
being stiff and universally cold, the fingers and toes contracted, and the
countenance livid. He was stripped of his wet clothes, put in hot blankets,
and bled twenty ounces. In half an hour, interrupted respiration commenced,
without inflating the lungs; in an hour more, regular pulsation and
breathing were established, together with power of swallowing; and in a
week he was quite well.”&mdash;<i>Ibid., p. 147.</i></p>

<p>In the <i>Lancet</i>, 1884, vol. i., p. 922, W. Arnold Thompson, F.R.C.S.I.,
reports a case of resuscitation of a child delivered by the forceps, which was
“apparently to myself [he says] and the nurse and relatives, a perfectly
dead child, and with no signs of respiration or life about it....
My opinion was that the death was real and positive, but that, there being
no actual disease present, and the blood still warm, the machinery of life
was set going, and resuscitation followed as a consequence of suitable means
being taken and persevered in without undue delay. In the future I do
not intend to allow any still-born children to be put away without making
strenuous efforts to restore vitality.”</p>

<p>The <i>Lancet</i>, 1880, vol. ii., p. 582:&mdash;In a discussion at the Royal
Medical and Chirurgical Society upon Artificial Respiration in New-born
Children, Dr. Roper related three cases in which the child was left for
dead. “One of these occurred in the practice of Mr. Brown, of St. Mary
Axe. The child was still-born in the absence of a medical man. It was
taken to the surgery, and thence to the late Mr. Solly, who next day, in
dissecting the body, found that the heart was still beating. A second
instance was of a fœtus of five months and a half, which was set aside as
dead, Dr. Roper attending the mother, who was suffering from hæmorrhage.
He was astonished next day to find that this immature child, which had
lain on the floor for eleven hours through a cold night, was breathing and
its heart beating....” Such examples show that the new-born have
greater tenacity of life than is supposed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>Lancet</i>, 1881, vol. ii., p. 430, under the heading of “The Burial of
Still-born Infants,” states that “Greater security for the due observance of
these necessary regulations (the Births and Deaths Registration Act of
1874), for the burial of infants said to be still-born, is urgently called for.
It is constantly patent that the burial of deceased infants as still-born, if
checked, is by no means prevented; and that the authorities of burial grounds,
by their laxity in carrying out the provisions of the Act, afford
dangerous facilities for the concealment of crime, or negligence, and for a
practice which threatens to impair the value of our birth and death
registration statistics; for, if a live-born infant be buried as still-born,
neither its birth nor its death is registered.”</p>

<p>A case of forceps-delivery occurred in the hands of the writer (E.P.V.), in
which the child, when extracted, was quite purple in colour, and absolutely
dead to all appearances&mdash;there was no breathing nor impulse to be found
anywhere. After some efforts at resuscitation in the way of artificial
respiration&mdash;not very thoroughly done, nor much prolonged (for the child
was believed to be dead)&mdash;with a warm bath and frictions, it was laid aside
and covered up. At a subsequent visit some hours later, the child was found
in the nurse’s lap, completely recovered, and changed in colour to a bright
pink. The nurse said she did not like to give the little fellow up, and by
breathing into his mouth for some time he showed returning life, and by
keeping it up he soon began to breathe himself.</p>

<p>Cases like this are believed to be not infrequent, because physicians and
nurses are not, as a general rule, aware of the great tenacity of life
possessed by the new-born infant.</p>

<p>“<i>Still-births</i> are not registered in England; but, under the new
Registration Act, no still-born child can be buried without a certificate
from a registered practitioner in attendance, or a declaration from a midwife,
to the effect that the child was still-born. The proportion of still-births
in this country is supposed to be about four per cent., but this is
uncertain.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">A. Newsholme</span>, <i>Vital Statistics, 1889, p. 61</i>.</p>

<p>“The proportion of deaths from premature births, compared with the
total number of births, in 1861-65 was 11·19 to 1,000 births; since which
time it has steadily increased, reaching the ratio of 15·89 per births in
1,000 in 1887.”&mdash;<i>Ibid., p. 216.</i></p>

<p>The same author, p. 17, states that “a certain proportion of the <i>births
remain unregistered</i>(<i>a</i>). There is strong reason for thinking that a certain
number of children born alive are buried as still-born.”</p>

<p class="pch">RECOVERY OF THE DROWNED.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">This</span> is perhaps the best known and most generally appreciated occasion
of rescuing the apparently dead. The high degree in which it has
excited public sympathy will appear from a glance at that section of the
“Bibliography” (towards the end of the eighteenth century) which gives
the titles of essays and reports connected with the Royal Humane Society
and the corresponding foreign institutions upon which our own was modelled.
The following general remarks and cases are from the essay of Dr. Struve,
of Görlitz, Lusatia, 1802:&mdash;</p>

<p>“A great number of persons apparently drowned have been restored to
life without the use of stimulants, merely by the renovated susceptibility of
irritation. I have collected thirty-six cases of persons apparently drowned
in Lusatia from the year 1772 to the year 1792. Most of them were
treated by uninformed people, and revived by friction and warming;
two persons, however, were indebted for their lives to the continuation of
the resuscitative process for several hours. The greatest number were
children; which is to be ascribed not only to the greater danger to which
they are exposed of drowning, but also to the longer continuance of vital
power in the infant frame” (p. 136).</p>

<p>“A boy of about a year and a half old had lain upwards of a quarter of
an hour in the water, and was found face downwards, and the whole body
livid and swollen. He was undressed, wiped dry, and wrapped in warm
blankets; but the most particular part of the process was rolling the body
upon a table, shaking it by the shoulders, and rubbing the feet. This
having been continued for an hour, a convulsive motion was observed in
the toes; sneezing was excited by snuff; the tongue stimulated by strong
vinegar; the throat irritated with a feather; an injection given. The child
vomited a large quantity of water, and in an hour afterwards began to
breathe, and was completely restored to life” (p. 137).</p>

<p>“A woman upwards of thirty years of age, and who was affected with
epilepsy, fell in a fit from a height of twenty feet into the water, where she
remained a full quarter of an hour before she was taken out. Mr. Redlich,
surgeon, of Hamburg, had her put into a bed warmed by hot bottles; she
was rubbed with warm flannels, some spirits were dropped into her mouth,
when in a quarter of an hour symptoms of life, such as convulsive motion
and a very weak pulse, appeared. In three hours from the time she was
taken out of the water she recovered completely” (p. 138).</p>

<p>Dr. Charles Londe, in a remarkable pamphlet (“Lettre sur la Mort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
Apparente, les Conséquences Réelles des Inhumations Précipitées, et le
Temps Pendent lequel peut persister l’Aptitude à étre Rapellé à la Vie.”
Paris, Bailliére, 1854), records some instances of narrow escapes from
premature burial of the drowned, one of which may be cited:&mdash;</p>

<p>“On the 13th of July, 1829, about two p.m., near the Pont des Arts,
Paris, a body, which appeared lifeless, was taken out of the river. It was
that of a young man, twenty years of age, dark-complexioned, and strongly
built. The corpse was discoloured and cold; the face and lips swollen and
tinged with blue; a thick and yellowish froth exuded from the mouth; the
eyes were open, fixed, and motionless; the limbs limp and drooping. <i>No
pulsation of the heart nor trace of respiration was perceptible.</i> The body had
remained under water for a considerable time; the search for it, made in
Dr. Bourgeois’s presence, lasted fully twenty minutes. That gentleman
did not hesitate to incur the derision of the lookers-on by proceeding to
attempt the resuscitation of what, in their eyes, was a mere lump of clay.
Nevertheless, several hours afterwards, the supposed corpse was restored
to life, thanks to the obstinate perseverance of the doctor, who, although a
strong man and enjoying robust health, was several times on the point of
losing courage and abandoning the patient in despair. But what would
have happened if Dr. Bourgeois, instead of persistently remaining stooping
over the inanimate body, with watchful eye and <i>attentive ear</i>, to catch the
first rustling of the heart, had left the drowned man, after half an hour’s
fruitless endeavour, as often happens? The unfortunate man would have
been laid in the grave, <i>although capable of restoration to life</i>!”</p>

<p>To this case, Dr. Bourgeois, in the “Archives de Medecine,” adds others,
in which individuals remained under water as long as <span class="smcap">SIX HOURS</span>, and
were recalled to life by efforts which a weaker conviction than his own
would have refrained from making. These facts lead Dr. Londe to the
conclusion that, <i>every day, drowned individuals are buried, who, with
greater perseverance, might be restored to life</i>!</p>

<p>The following case in point appears in the <i>Sunnyside</i>, New York, communicated
by J. W. Green, M.D.:&mdash;</p>

<p>“A few years since I was walking by the Central Park, near One
Hundred and Tenth Street and Fifth Avenue. Noticing a crowd that was
acting in an unusual manner by the side of the lake, I approached and
inquired of one of the bystanders what was the cause of the excitement.
He replied, ‘A boy is drowned.’ I advanced to the edge of the water, and
saw two or three men in the water searching for the body. As they had
not yet discovered it, I made enquiries, and found at last a small boy who
had been a comrade of the victim. He showed me the spot from which
the boy had fallen. I then pointed out to the searchers where to look, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
immediately the body was recovered. I took it at once from the hands of
the person who had it, and held it reversed, in order to disembarrass it of
all the water possible, for a minute or two, then stripped it of its clothing,
sent for a blanket and brandy. I took a woollen coat from one of the
bystanders until the blanket should arrive, laid the child upon it and commenced
to rotate it. This I continued to do for at least fifteen minutes by
the watch. I then tried auscultation; no murmur could be heard.</p>

<p>“The skin was cold, the lips were blue. Every artery was still. With
all these signs of death present it was still obligatory upon me to persevere.
At the end of fifteen minutes there was a slight gasp. A small quantity of
brandy was placed upon the tongue. A little of this ran into the larynx,
and the stimulation was sufficient to produce a long inspiration and then a
cough. This was more than a half-hour from the time when the boy had
been removed from the water. Complete restoration did not occur until
nearly an hour from that time. He was now given to his mother, and I was
informed on the following day that he entirely recovered, without an
unfavourable symptom.”</p>

<p>The three following cases of resuscitation from apparent death by
drowning are copied from the most recent reports of the Royal Humane
Society, London:&mdash;</p>

<p>“On 13th of August, 1895, Samuel Lawrence, aged five years, while playing
on the bank of a disused clay-pit at South Bank, Yorkshire, fell into
the water and sank. Two of his companions dived into the water, and
brought him up after a submersion of from seven to ten minutes in an
unconscious state. Two working men commenced artificial respiration,
and Dr. Steele continued it for ten hours before the boy showed signs of
returning sensibility and his complete recovery.”</p>

<p>“October 6th, 1895.&mdash;At Deptford, Surrey, a woman with a baby in her
arms threw herself into the canal. They were rescued by the Royal
Humane Society’s drags. Two ladies took possession of the bodies (time of
submersion not stated), and they employed Silvester’s system of artificial
respiration with success, in the case of the woman in about one hour, and
with the child one hour and a half.”</p>

<p>“August 6th, 1895.&mdash;At Bradford, England, Rudolf Pratt, a clerk with
Midland R.R. Company, was bathing, and sank in deep water. A
bystander by diving brought him up. After a submersion of five minutes,
unconscious, and not breathing, Dr. Oldham restored respiration by
Sylvester’s method after one and a half hour’s treatment.”</p>

<p>These three cases are instructive on account of the length of time animation
remained suspended before it could be aroused to a state of activity;
and they lead to the belief that many cases that are given up as actually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
dead could be saved if efforts at resuscitation were kept up for a lengthened
period, as in the first case.</p>

<p>In cases of drowning some persons are quickly revived after a long
submersion; others again who are under water only a short time require
artificial respiration for a long time before they show signs of returning life,
as was the case with Samuel Lawrence, who was submerged only ten
minutes, yet required ten hours’ active treatment to revive him.</p>

<p class="psh">EVIDENCE OF RESUSCITATIONS IN GRAVE-YARDS.</p>

<p>Reference has been made in this volume to the discoveries of premature
burial brought to light during the investigations of charnel-houses in
France, and the removal of grave-yards, necessitated through the rapid
expansion of towns, in America. The <i>Casket</i>, Rochester, New York, U.S.,
of March 2, 1896, gives a detailed narrative of recent discoveries made by
T. M. Montgomery in the removal of Fort Randall Cemetery, with the condition
of the bodies found as to decay or state of preservation, and says:&mdash;</p>

<p>“We found among these remains two that bore every evidence of having
been buried alive. The first case was that of a soldier that had been
struck by lightning. Upon opening the lid of the coffin we found that the
legs and arms had drawn up as far as the confines of the coffin would
permit. The other was a case of death resulting from alcoholism. The
body was slightly turned, the legs were drawn up a trifle, and the hands
were clutching the clothing. In the coffin was found a large whisky flask,
showing that those who buried him were not his friends, or else that they too
were afflicted with the disease that had cut short the life of their companion.</p>

<p>“It occurred to us at that time that this was a great argument in favour
of incineration. Nearly two per cent. of those exhumed here were, no
doubt, victims of suspended animation. Once before in our experience
have we noted this; and while not believing in as large a percentage of
live burials as the radical advocates of cremation claim, yet we know that
the percentage is larger than most scientists give. Disinterment is the
only solution of the question. In regard to these two cases, we wish to
say that science has proved that electricity does not always kill, and that
persons addicted to the liquor habit, after long debauches, sometimes
relapse into a comatose state, and are to all appearances dead. Statistics
show that a great many die annually of these causes, hence the percentage
in cases of this kind must be very large. What is the remedy?”</p>

<p class="psh">HASTY EMBALMMENTS IN THE UNITED STATES.</p>

<p>The <i>Casket</i>, Rochester, New York, September, 1896, observes:&mdash;At
different times considerable opposition has been raised against embalming
by Boards of Health and other officials in various localities, on account of
the haste with which the embalmer proceeds with his duties. A few recent
cases of supposed corpses recovering, one of which occurred in Philadelphia,
Pa., have revived the question, and it is reported that the Philadelphia
Board of Health may take action looking to the enactment of a law prescribing
the period of time which should elapse after death before a body
should be embalmed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span></p>

<p>In a recent issue of the Philadelphia <i>Times</i>, Funeral-Director John
J. O’Rourke, a well-known professional of that city, expresses himself on
the subject as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>“These two narrow escapes from burial alive have further impressed me
with one of the perils attending the disposition of the dead&mdash;I mean the
danger of hasty embalming. As you know, in most cases the doctor who has
had the patient is not called in after death, and very often the relatives of
the deceased expect the undertaker, if embalming is to be done, to proceed
with it at once. All the embalming schools teach that the only proper
way to thus treat the body is by use of fluids through the arteries. But
in the lectures on the subject no period that should be permitted to elapse
before it is begun is prescribed, and, as a rule, it follows dissolution as
quickly as possible.</p>

<p>“I contend that there should be some law or official rule governing the
matter, because after the artery is punctured and the fluid goes through the
whole body, it is sure to destroy any spark of life that might remain. I
have never met with any cases of resuscitation myself, but have had
instances of deaths that made me hesitate in the work of embalming. Some
months ago a man came to me fifteen minutes after a relative had breathed
his last, and asked me to embalm the body. I went to the house, and,
after seeing the corpse, refused, saying that I would not do it until after
the expiration of twelve hours. The man had died of consumption, yet,
for fear of it being a case of suspended animation, I would take no
chances.</p>

<p>“At another time a person had died of dropsy. Within half an hour I
was summoned. The attending physician had not been there, and twenty-four
hours afterwards he gave a certificate of death from cancer. The body
was very warm when I arrived, and neighbours who had kindly volunteered
to prepare it were doubtful if life was extinct. I had the corpse laid on an
embalming table for two hours, and then placed it in what is known as a
Saratoga patent box, in which are pans filled with salted ice, so arranged
that cold air circulates around the body. Had this been a case of suspended
animation, it would have taken several hours to dispel the heat within the
corpse.</p>

<p>“Of course there are some supposed unmistakable signs. The only positive
signs of dissolution are those which depend on molecular change or
death-rigidity of the muscles of the whole body, and putrefaction of the
tissues. These are most marked in organs and tissues the vital functions of
which are the most active. The action of the heart, the movements of
respiration, may be reduced as to be altogether imperceptible, so that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
functions of circulation and respiration appear to be arrested. This is
occasionally observed in temporary syncope, in which a person to all
appearances dead has, after a time, regained consciousness and recovered.</p>

<p>“The peculiar condition of the nervous system called catalepsy, and the
state of trance, are likewise further examples of the so-called apparent
deaths; but, on the occurrence of actual death, the irritability of the
muscles by degrees disappears, electricity no longer excites their contraction,
and then cadaverous rigidity sets in.... Some action will, in
all probability, be urged upon the next Legislature or upon the Board of
Health.”</p>

<h2 class="p4"><a id="appe" name="appe">APPENDIX E.</a></h2>

<p class="pch">SUMMARY OF ORDINANCES, ETC., RELATING TO THE
INSPECTION OF CORPSES AND OF INTERMENTS.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">In</span> the sixteenth Council of Milan, Saint Charles Borromeo prohibited
burials before twelve hours after ordinary cases of death, and twenty-four
hours after cases of sudden death. As early as the sixteenth century
serious attention in the examination of the dead was made obligatory by
the enactment of Article 149 of the Criminal Statutes of Charles the Fifth.
This was the foundation of legal medicine in Germany. In France, a
similar ordinance was first established in 1789.</p>

<p class="psh">NETHERLANDS.<br />
<i>Act of April 10th, 1869.</i></p>

<p>No burial is allowed without the written permission of the Civil
Recorder, granted upon the production of a certificate of a qualified
physician, and not until thirty-six hours have elapsed after death, nor
later than the fifth day after death. But this regulation can be set
aside, and a longer period allowed, by the Burgomaster, on the application
of a doctor.</p>

<p>Dead-houses are in use for bodies dead of infectious diseases.</p>

<p class="psh">FRANKFORT-ON-THE-MAIN.</p>

<p>Death must first be established by a licensed physician, who carefully
examines the body for that purpose, and, if satisfied, then issues a
certificate which states the name, age, sex, place, and date, and immediate
cause of death. The certificate is taken within twenty-four hours after the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
death to the Standesamt, where the death is recorded, and a certificate to
that effect is given, and presented to the Cemetery Commission, which
assigns the place of burial. The corpse is required to remain unburied
three days, either at the place of death or at the mortuary, where it is
under the observation of attendants; but there is no State-appointed inspector
of the dead, nor electric bells or other means for announcing and recording
any movements of the body. The system of inspection and certification
by qualified physicians, with the delay of three days, and the favourable
condition of the dead-houses, have been the means of preventing the living
from being mistaken for the dead in a number of cases.</p>

<p class="psh">FRANCE.</p>

<p>Interments must not take place, according to Article 77 of the Code
Napoleon, before twenty-four hours of death, but in practice it is twenty-four
hours after death-notification by the <i>mort-verificateur</i>. During
epidemics, or when deaths occur from infectious or contagious diseases,
the interments must invariably be made within twenty-four hours of death.</p>

<p>Article 77 of the Civil Code states that “No burial shall take place
without an authorisation, on free paper and without expense, of the officer
of the Civil State, who will not be empowered to deliver it, unless after
having visited the deceased person, nor unless twenty-four hours after
the decease, except in cases provided for by the regulations of the police.”
It results from this that no corpse can be buried before a minimum delay
of twenty-four hours shall have expired after the decease. The formal
record of the decease must be made by the officer of the Civil State (the
mayor), or, which is what takes place in most of the communes, by a
medical man delegated by the mayor, and who takes the title of medical
officer of the Civil State.</p>

<p>The Article 77 of the Civil Code is generally strictly observed in Paris
and in other cities of France. The obligation to await the delay of twenty-four
hours is intended to prevent too hasty burials. One considers, in fact,
that that delay is generally necessary in order to be able to have certain
proofs of death.</p>

<p>By Article 358 of the Penal Code, the burial of a deceased person without
such authorisation is punishable by a maximum period of two months’
imprisonment, and a maximum fine of fifty francs, without prejudice to other
criminal proceedings which may be applicable under the circumstances.</p>

<p>Exceptions, however, have been established in certain cases. For example,
in times of epidemics, or of too rapid decomposition of the corpse
in the usual case, there is urgent need, in fact, to bury the body of a person
attacked with a contagious or epidemic malady, in order to suppress one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
the causes of propagation of the epidemic, or of the contagion. In the
second case, it is understood that one could not keep longer, without
danger to the public health, a corpse in complete putrefaction. There is
occasion also to observe that, in these circumstances, the end which the
legislator has proposed to himself is equally obtained, since there cannot
be any doubt as to the real death. However that may be, it is the mayor
(officer of the Civil State) to whom it appertains, according to the terms of
the Article 77 of the Civil Code, to give authority to bury; and if he gives
that authorisation before the expiration of the delay of twenty-four hours, it
is after having established by himself, or by the medical officer of the Civil
State, the fact of its necessity, resulting from the circumstances of which
we have just spoken.</p>

<p>It is to be remarked that the Article 77 fixes a <i>minimum</i> and <i>not a
maximum</i> delay. It is always the mayor to whom it appertains to fix the
day and the hour of the burial, and there may happen such and such a
circumstance which necessitates a delay of the obsequies. The mayor need
only assure himself in that case that no danger will result to the public
health, which naturally is the case when the corpse is embalmed, or is
placed in a leaden coffin.</p>

<p>Outside Paris and other large cities, and especially in the rural districts,
much laxity prevails both as to verification of death and the time of burial,
and cases of premature burial are not infrequent.</p>

<p class="psh">AUSTRIA.</p>

<p>The laws relative to funerals and burials are very strict&mdash;perhaps
the most thorough in their requirements of any in Europe. They
provide for a very careful inspection of the body by medical inspectors,
quite independently of the attending physicians, in order to ascertain if the
death be absolute. Minute and specific official directions guide them as to
the method of examination and the signs of death to be looked for. And
they further provide for carrying out any particular method, as to which the
deceased may have given directions, in order to prevent a possible revival
in the coffin. Should the surviving relatives desire it, a <i>post-mortem</i> operation
may be made upon the body, in the presence of the medical inspectors
and the police; in which case the heart is pierced through; and a full report
of the operations must be forwarded to the civic magistrate. A fee of six
florins is allowed for such an operation.</p>

<p class="psh">CITY OF VIENNA.</p>

<p>Every death to be inquired into by the municipal physician. The first
of five objects is to ascertain whether the person be really dead. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
examining whether there are any remaining indications of life, he will rely
not upon any one sign, nor even upon putrefaction, but upon the totality of
the signs of death. If there are any indications of life remaining, he must
at once institute the means of resuscitation approved by science, and continue
them until such time as the family medical attendant is assured of
their uselessness. If there be any doubt as to the reality of the death, a
second inspection of the body is to be made by the municipal physician
within twenty-four hours. Burial, as a rule, is not to be until forty-eight
hours after death; but the interval may be shortened in cases of infectious
diseases or of unusually rapid decomposition.</p>

<p class="psh">PROVINCE OF DALMATIA.<br />
<i>Vice-Governor’s Order of 29th April, 1894.</i></p>

<p>Every death to be inquired into by the parish physician, or a deputy
appointed by the mayor. The first of six objects of the inquest is to
ascertain whether the person be really dead. In the event of a non-medical
examiner discovering signs of life, he is to send for a doctor.
Inasmuch as decomposition, the only sure sign of death, is, as a rule,
a phenomenon of later occurrence than the time appointed for the inquest
(within twelve hours of the notification of death), the examining person
must base his certainty of the extinction of life, not upon one sign, but
upon the totality of the signs of death.</p>

<p>The burial of a corpse must not take place until seventy-two hours after
death, and the signs of decomposition are clearly visible. Any proposed
departure from this rule, in the event of earlier putrefaction, or the absence
of decomposition at the end of seventy-two hours, requires the authority of
a physician called in. By the above Law, the following Orders are suspended:
(1) the Order of 11th February, 1792, concerning the treatment
of the dead, and the precautions necessary to prevent the apparently dead
from being buried prematurely; (2) the General Order of 13th February,
1801, concerning precautionary measures in the burial of those dead of
infectious diseases; (3) the Law of 22nd June, 1841, together with the
Administrative Orders, concerning the examination of corpses and the
establishment of mortuaries.</p>

<p class="psh">CITY OF MUNICH.<br />
<i>Order of 30th October, 1848.</i></p>

<p>The ordinance hitherto in force, as to making an incision in the sole of
the foot in cases of patients who die in the hospitals, is abolished; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
hospital physicians to use their discretion whether or not the incision
should be made; but, in cases for which is demanded an earlier burial than
is usually prescribed, whether they have been hospital or private patients,
the incision is to be made in the sole of the foot at the end of the second
inspection, and every other means taken to ascertain whether the death be
apparent or real.</p>

<p class="psh">CALCUTTA.</p>

<p>1. The prevailing custom for Christians and Mahomedans is to bury the
dead. The Hindoos burn them as a rule, but many prefer to throw them
into a sacred river, particularly the Ganges or its tributaries, if they can do
so unmolested by the authorities.</p>

<p>2. There are no mortuaries. The signs which are assumed to indicate
death are the various conditions and appearances when animation is
suspended.</p>

<p>3. Cases of revival from supposed death are sometimes heard of among
the Hindoos, who regard such persons as outcasts. If the signs of returning
life are not very manifest when a person begins to revive, he is sometimes
killed by stuffing the mouth and nose with mud, which generally accomplishes
the object.</p>

<p class="psh">BOMBAY.</p>

<p>1. There are no laws or regulations in India for the disposal of the dead.
The customs and formalities follow the traditions and requirements of
religious belief.</p>

<p class="pind"><i>a.</i> The Hindoos burn their dead immediately after death takes place.</p>

<p class="pind"><i>b.</i> The Parsees take their dead to a “Tower of Silence” as soon as
death takes place, and, after certain prescribed ceremonies, the
body is speedily devoured by vultures.</p>

<p class="pind"><i>c.</i> The Europeans and Mahomedans bury their dead within from twenty-four
to forty-eight hours, because putrefaction usually sets in soon
after death on account of the heat and humidity of the climate.</p>

<p>2. There are no mortuaries, excepting in connection with hospitals, where
observations can be made.</p>

<p class="psh">CAPE TOWN, AFRICA.</p>

<p>1. There are no laws nor regulations relative to the disposal of the dead,
excepting in cases requiring an inquest or <i>post-mortem</i> examination. The
custom is to bury within twenty-four to thirty hours after death, but the
time is sometimes extended to two or three days.</p>

<p>2. There are no dead-houses, except at the hospitals, which are under the
management of the superintendent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span></p>

<p>3. The certificate of the medical attendant is sufficient for burial purposes.
The complete cessation of respiration and the heart’s action are
considered an absolute indication of death. When decomposition sets in,
it usually appears within twenty-four hours after death, although in winter
that process may be longer delayed.</p>

<p class="psh">MOSCOW.</p>

<p>Orthodox Russians keep their dead three days before burial. During
that time the body lies with the face uncovered, and a deacon chants and
prays over it twice a day. A medical certificate of death is imperative
before burial.</p>

<p class="psh">BRUSSELS.</p>

<p>Burials are regulated by the Communal Council in accordance with law.
The system is complicated, but thorough. The medical men connected
with the Government Medical Service (“Doctors of the Civil Government”)
have the sole control of the examinations of deaths, as well as births,
accidents, sudden deaths, suicides; and attend to burials, autopsies, postponements
of burials, etc., on their own motion. Interments usually take
place within forty-eight hours of death, but they may be carried out sooner
during epidemics for the public safety.</p>

<p>There are mortuaries in the city and suburbs, to which bodies may be
taken at the request of surviving relatives, or by the order of the health
authorities, according to private necessities or for the public safety. Except
by the special authorisation of the officers of the civil government, bodies
cannot remain in the mortuaries longer than forty-eight hours; and a burial
cannot take place in less than twenty-four hours. Special care is taken to
test the reality of death in still-born infants, and efforts are made to revive
them, as well as all other cases of seeming death. In cases of women
dying during advanced pregnancy, the infant must be roused by artificial
respiration, in order to restore animation if possible. The process for
obtaining a delay for burial is intricate and cumbersome, and to a foreigner
unaccustomed to the language and the local usages the chances would be
against securing such a permit before the time allowed for burial had
transpired.</p>

<p class="psh">DENMARK.</p>

<p>Mortuaries are connected with all the churches, cemeteries, and some of
the hospitals, and are growing in favour in the country places; but as yet
they are unprovided with any appliances for the resuscitation of the
apparently dead, or for the prevention of premature burials. No corpse,
however, is allowed to be taken to a mortuary before it has been inspected,
and a death-certificate issued by a qualified physician; but, when this is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
done, death is considered absolute. No corpse is allowed to remain in any
church, chapel, or mortuary longer than seven days after supposed death,
without special permission. Coffins that contain bodies which have died
from infectious diseases must be so indicated, and cannot be opened in the
mortuaries.</p>

<p>As a rule, bodies are kept seventy-two hours before burial. The signs
that are considered sufficient to establish death are the glazed appearance
of the eyes, livid spots on the skin, and muscular rigidity. In doubtful
cases, the time before burial can be extended by authority of the Board of
Health, of which the Police Director is a member.</p>

<p class="psh">SPAIN.</p>

<p>Burials usually do not take place until twenty-four hours after death.
For example, if a death takes place about four p.m., the burial is made late
in the following afternoon. In time of epidemic, bodies are hurried to the
cemeteries, where depositories are provided, which are under the care of
watchers until the expiration of twenty-four hours after death. The
certificate of a reputable physician as to death is sufficient to authorise
burial. Relatives or friends usually remain with the body until burial,
excepting in cases when judicial proceedings are held over it to determine
the circumstances of the death.</p>

<p class="psh">IRELAND.</p>

<p>There are no laws in Ireland regarding the disposal of the dead, but the
Sanitary Acts of the United Kingdom can be applied in any case within a
reasonable period, on the ground of public health. There is no fixed
period for keeping a body before burial. The Roman Catholics usually
bury on the third or fourth day after death; but in some districts custom
sanctions burial within twenty-four or thirty-six hours. Local burial
authorities sometimes require a medical certificate before burial, but, there
being no legal obligation for it, this is often omitted. In cases of suicide,
sudden death, or death by violence, the Coroner holds an inquest, and
gives a certificate accordingly.</p>

<p>There are no dead-houses in Ireland, where bodies may be observed for
a period of time before burial.</p>

<p>Concerning burials in England, see Glen’s “Burial Acts” for the general
burial practice; also “Regulations for Wilton Cemetery.”</p>

<p class="psh">THE UNITED STATES.</p>

<p>In the United States of America, as a rule, everything relative to the
disposal of the dead is regulated by local Boards of Health, as authorised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
by State laws. A burial cannot take place without a certificate from a
legally licensed physician, which must state the cause of death; the place
and time when it occurred; the full name; age; sex; colour; occupation;
birth-place; names and birth-places of both parents. There are no laws
or regulations that require the inspection of the body to verify the fact of
death (the certificate, as in England, as to the cause is considered sufficient
for this purpose), and no time is fixed when a body must, or must not, be
buried. This is regulated by, and left to, the convenience of the family
of the deceased, by the season of the year, by the opinion of the attending
physician, etc. But the Health Officers can order the burial whenever, in
their opinion, the public health requires it. As a rule, burials after supposed
death are made sooner in the South, and among the poor, than in
the North, and among the well-to-do classes. In remote unsettled regions
burials not seldom take place without these formalities, and they are often
carried out in a hasty manner; but usually they do not take place till three
days after supposed death, and sometimes, particularly in cold weather, a
longer time is allowed. All large cemeteries have chambers for the
temporary deposit of bodies, but they are not under observation, as it is
taken for granted that they are dead.</p>

<h2 class="p4"><a id="appf" name="appf">APPENDIX F.</a></h2>

<p class="pch">THE JEWISH PRACTICE OF EARLY BURIAL.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">R. J. Wunderbar</span>, in his standard work on “Biblisch-talmudische
Medicin,” Riga and Leipzig, 1850-60, gives, in pp. 5-15 of the concluding
section (Abtheil. 4, Bd. ii.), the following summary of the origin of the
peculiar Jewish practice of burying the corpse within a few hours of death:&mdash;</p>

<p>In the Levitical law (Num. xix. 11-22) every dead body was an
unclean thing, including those dead in the tent and on the battlefield.
Touching a corpse involved purification and separation for seven days.
This ordinance is supposed to have had a sanitary motive, having probably
originated with cases of infectious disease. There is only one Biblical
ordinance as to early burial, and that is indubitably restricted to persons
executed for crime: Deut. xxi. 22, 23, “And if a man have committed a
sin worthy of death, and he be put to death, and thou hang him on a tree,
his body shall not remain all night upon the tree, but thou shalt in any wise
bury him that day (for he that is hanged is accursed of God), that thy land
be not defiled which the Lord thy God giveth thee for an inheritance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>”This statutory limit to the exposure of the bodies of malefactors was the
most convenient way of checking the practice, common in other countries,
of leaving corpses of criminals to hang upon the gibbet until they
rotted, or were consumed by birds of prey. Its motive was to prevent,
by the promptest measure, an indefinite degree of neglect in altogether
special cases.</p>

<p>There is nothing else in the Bible concerning early burial; on the
contrary, the patriarchal practice, in the case of eminent persons, seems to
have been to keep the body for a considerable time above ground, after the
manner of Egypt. Prior to the Babylonian exile there is not a trace of the
later practice of speedy burial. The post-Talmudic custom had arisen
entirely from a misunderstanding. It is true that the Talmud enjoins that
corpses&mdash;according to circumstances&mdash;be kept unburied not longer than
one day; but it also permits them to lie above ground for days, so that
elaborate funeral preparations might be made, or time given for mourners
to arrive from a distance. Lastly, the Talmud relates the burial of one
apparently dead who revived and lived for twenty-five years, and begat
five children; whereupon a rabbinical ordinance was made that the corpse
(which would have been laid in a vault or in a tomb above ground) should
be visited diligently until three days after death. (The references to the
Talmud are: Semachoth 8; Moedkaton 1, 6; Sabbat 151, 152;
Sanhedrin 46a.)</p>

<p>Wunderbar admits that there had been cases of premature burial among
the Jews, but he asserts their extreme rarity, and doubts the authenticity of
most of the traditional or historical cases in general.</p>

<p>In Jewish circles in Germany towards the end of last century there was
much controversy as to the inexpediency of the practice of early burial.
In the “Berlinische Monatschrift” for April, 1787, p. 329, (cited by
Marcus Herz, “Ueber die frühe Beerdigung der Juden,” Berlin, 1788,
p. 6,) there is printed a letter from Moses Mendelssohn to the Jews of
Mecklenburg, in which he advises them to keep their dead unburied for
three days. “I know well,” he adds, “that you will not follow my
advice; for the might of custom is great. Nay, I shall perhaps appear to
you as a heretic on account of my counsel. All the same, I have freed my
conscience from guilt.”</p>

<p>The above-cited essay by Dr. Marcus Herz, of Berlin, arguing
against the Jewish practice, called forth a reply by Dr. Marx, of
Hanover, who was of opinion that the burial might safely proceed after
the body had been left on the bed for three hours, and had then been
pronounced lifeless by the medical attendant, according to the practice
in that part of the country. To that Dr. Herz rejoined, in a second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
edition, that the medical attendant was no better judge than an ordinary
man, inasmuch as all experimental tests were fallacious, and decomposition
the only sure sign. He cites the following statement by an
experienced Jewish physician, Dr. Hirschberg, of Königsberg (from the
Jewish periodical, “Sammler,” vol. ii., p. 153):&mdash;“I have practised
medicine for forty years, and have always grieved over the practice
amongst us of too hasty burial of the dead&mdash;on the day of decease.
It happened once in my practice that a woman lay for dead three
days and then awoke and revived. At first I would not allow the body to
be moved from the bed, but the undertaker’s men violently resisted me,
taking up the body and laying it on the ground. According to their custom,
they would have buried it the same day, had I not earnestly called out to
them: ‘Beware lest you do lay her in the ground this day! She is still
alive, and the blame will be on you.’ I had her covered with warm,
woollen clothes; on the following morning some signs of life were manifest;
she lay still, and gradually awoke out of her death-slumber.”</p>

<p>Herz declared, as Wunderbar did subsequently, that the passages in the
Talmud on which the Jewish custom was based had been misinterpreted;
and he specially accused the rabbis Jacob Emden, of Altona, and Ezechel,
of Prague, of rabbinical subtilty on the one hand, and of a fallacious
dependence upon scientific signs of death on the other.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p>At the World’s Medical Congress (Division of Eclectic Medicine), held
in Chicago, June 3, 1893, the following resolution was proposed by Dr.
John V. Stevens, and adopted:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pind">“Whereas we believe that many persons in the past, in the condition
simulating death from various causes, have been buried alive;
therefore,</p>

<p class="pind1">“Resolved&mdash;That it should be the duty of all Governments to
pass laws prohibiting the burial of bodies without positive proofs of
death; that the nature of these proofs should be taught in all
schools and printed in all newspapers throughout the world.”</p>

In the 3rd ed., by Dr. Pye Smith, the following occurs at p. 817 of
vol. i., under “Trance”:&mdash;“These are the cases which have led to the
popular belief that death is sometimes only apparent, and that there may
be a danger of persons being buried alive; and it cannot be denied that a
patient in such a condition might easily be allowed to die by careless or
ignorant attendants, or might be buried before death.”</p>

“Pour se convaincre de l’erreur où l’on tomberait en adoptant cette
opinion populaire, il suffit de refléchir d’abord qu’un cercueil n’est pas
exactement moulé sur les proportions du corps qu’il contient; que, par
consequent, tous les intervalles sont remplis d’air respirable, en quantité
très-grande, égale à-peu-près à un cube dont le côté aurait 50 centimètres de
hauteur. Or, chaque inspiration absorbe environ 1,200 centimètres cubes
d’air dont l’oxygène n’est employé dans l’hématose que pour sa cinquième
partie, le reste étant rendu pendant l’expiration; il en resulte donc que
chaque inspiration ne consomme en réalité que 240 centimètres cubes.
L’homme, à l’état normal, respire à-peu-près 800 fois par heure; et, comme
un cube de 50 centimètres de côté contient 125,000 centimètres cubes,
on doit conclure que cette quantité d’air peut suffire à 520 inspirations
normales, c’est à dire à soutenir la vie pendant près de trois quarts d’heure.
Mais, d’un autre côté, il est démontré, en botanique, que l’air filtre dans la
terre; celui contenu dans le cercueil peut donc en partie se renouveler.
On doit nécessairement tenir compte de la nature du terrain où le cercueil
à été déposé; s’il est sec, léger ou sablonneux, il laissera pénétrer, circuler
pour, ainsi dire, l’air atmosphérique plus facilement, que des terres humides,
grasses ou argileuses. Ajoutons enfin, que les quantités determinées plus
haut pourraient être réduites de plus de moitié, sans causer directement la
mort. On voit donc qu’un homme peut vivre sous terre pendant plusieurs
heures, et que ce temps sera d’autant plus court que le sujet sera plus
pléthorique, c’est-à-dire predisposé aux congestions cérébrales, puisque,
dans ce cas, ses inspirations seront plus larges et plus frequentes.”</p>

The <i>British Medical Journal</i>, August 15, 1894, p. 381, reports a
“Discussion on the Overcrowding of the Profession,” in which Dr.
Frederick H. Alderson says:&mdash;“The very crowded condition of the
medical profession concerns a very large body of the profession; neither is
the evil limited to any particular section of it. Our physicians are too
numerous, our surgeons alike too many, and our general practitioners are
legion.”</p>

During the five years ending 1895 the population of France, where of all European
countries premature burial is most in vogue, has increased by only 133,819, or, leaving out
the immigration of alien population, the increase is under 30,000. The population for
all practical purposes may be regarded as stationary.</p>

With reference to the burial customs in Ireland, the <i>Kings County Chronicle</i>,
Parsonstown, September 17, 1896, says:&mdash;“Young children are buried the day after
death, but adults are waked for two, and sometimes three nights.”</p></div></div>

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when

  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
